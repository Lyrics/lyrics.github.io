# Static website

It may be useful to have static HTML files generated from the lyrics database
in case you wanted to establish your own lyrics website which requires no
JavaScript support to navigate.


### A small note

As of late 2016, this approach did not work for hosting the website
on github pages due to the large amount of files.


### Building

`make build`
