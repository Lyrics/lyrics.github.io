<br/><span></span>Are we every gonna learn from our mistakes?
<br/><span></span>Our innocence, our ignorance were lost but they’ll be found
<br/><span></span>The innocence of years we spent<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>I remember the day, between the past and the pain
<br/><span></span>We were never afraid of places unknown
<br/><span></span>There was nothing to fear, there was faith in the air
<br/><span></span>We will never be scared of letting go
<br/><span></span>What happened to the world I used to know?
<br/><span></span>What happened to the world I used to know?
<br/><span></span>What happened to the world I used to know?<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>We’ve been given all these chances everyday
<br/><span></span>Another step to take in this could change
<br/><span></span>Our innocence, our ignorance were lost but they’ll be found
<br/><span></span>The innocence of years we spent<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>I remember the day, between the past and the pain
<br/><span></span>We were never afraid of places unknown
<br/><span></span>There was nothing to fear, there was faith in the air

<br/><span></span>What happened to the world I used to know?<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>Even though it’s not the same
<br/><span></span>Remember when we made our first steps
<br/><span></span>It’s always just a thought away
<br/><span></span>Holding on to never forget
<br/><span></span>I still feel it now<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>I remember the days, between the past and the pain
<br/><span></span>We were never afraid of places unknown
<br/><span></span>There was nothing to fear, there was faith in the air
