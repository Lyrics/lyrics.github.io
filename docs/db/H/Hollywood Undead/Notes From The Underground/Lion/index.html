<br/><span></span>Do you see a lion when you look inside of me?
<br/><span></span>Outside the window just to watch you as you sleep
<br/><span></span>’Cause I am a lion born from things you cannot be<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>How can I sleep at night? There’s a war inside my head
<br/><span></span>I found a lion hidden right beneath my bed
<br/><span></span>I will not hide myself from the tears that you have shed
<br/><span></span>’Cause I am a lion and you are dead<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>Here’s a story of everything we’ll ever be
<br/><span></span>You can hide but some of us can never leave
<br/><span></span>And if you go I don’t need those little things
<br/><span></span>That remind me of all our little dreams
<br/><span></span>Can you hear the words? All I can say
<br/><span></span>We can watch the world, even if they walk away
<br/><span></span>Forget about tomorrow, tomorrow is today
<br/><span></span>You were born a lion and a lion you will stay<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>I am a lion and I want to be free
<br/><span></span>Do you see a lion when you look inside of me?
<br/><span></span>Outside the window just to watch you as you sleep
<br/><span></span>’Cause I am a lion born from things you cannot be<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>Remember an army of all those little kids?
<br/><span></span>Living life like they only get a little bit
<br/><span></span>It’s hard to fight when you’re born in the middle and
<br/><span></span>I’d rather die, won’t watch you givin’ in
<br/><span></span>I’m sorry daughter but your father’s not the same
<br/><span></span>I can look into your eyes and I swear that I will change
<br/><span></span>But tomorrow is tomorrow so forgive me if I stay
<br/><span></span>You can hide beneath the covers while I hide behind the pain<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>After all, only so much we can say
<br/><span></span>Words can lose their meaning once you walk away
<br/><span></span>Promise that you’ll love me, watch me as I fade
<br/><span></span>I’ll give you all those things that these liars never gave
<br/><span></span>The hands on the clock and the things we cannot change
<br/><span></span>Tear it all to pieces and take back what I made
<br/><span></span>If there’s one thing I’d keep, it’s you that I would save
<br/><span></span>’Cause I am just a lion and a lion I will stay<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>I am a lion and I want to be free
<br/><span></span>Do you see a lion when you look inside of me?
<br/><span></span>Outside the window just to watch you as you sleep
<br/><span></span>’Cause I am a lion born from things you cannot be<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>Hey, I never meant to let go
<br/><span></span>All I want and you’re all I ever wanna know
<br/><span></span>Can’t hide in the attic of a pretty home
<br/><span></span>Of a pretty home, of a pretty home
<br/><span></span>Hey, I never meant to let go
<br/><span></span>All I want and you’re all I ever wanna know
<br/><span></span>Can’t hide in the attic of a pretty home
<br/><span></span>Of a pretty home, of a pretty home<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>Hey<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>I am a lion and I want to be free
<br/><span></span>Do you see a lion when you look inside of me?
<br/><span></span>Outside the window just to watch you as you sleep
<br/><span></span>’Cause I am a lion born from things you cannot be<br/><span></span><br/><span></span><br></div><hr><table><tbody><tr><td>Song name&nbsp;</td><td>Lion</td><tr><td>Artist&nbsp;</td><td>Hollywood Undead</td><tr><td>Album&nbsp;</td><td>Notes From The Underground</td></tbody></table><div id="lyrics-actions"><a href="https://github.com/Lyrics/lyrics-database/edit/master/database/H/Hollywood Undead/Notes From The Underground/Lion">Suggest improvements for this text</a><br></div></div></div></div><script>var i=document.createElement("input");i.name="q";i.type="search";i.placeholder="Search";document.forms[0].firstChild.appendChild(i)</script>
