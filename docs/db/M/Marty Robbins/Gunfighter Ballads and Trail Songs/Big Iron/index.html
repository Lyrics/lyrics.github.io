<br/><span></span>Rode a stranger one fine day
<br/><span></span>Hardly spoke to folks around him
<br/><span></span>Didn’t have too much to say
<br/><span></span>No one dared to ask his business
<br/><span></span>No one dared to make a slip
<br/><span></span>The stranger there among them
<br/><span></span>Had a big iron on his hip
<br/><span></span>Big iron on his hip<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>It was early in the morning
<br/><span></span>When he rode into the town
<br/><span></span>He came riding from the south side
<br/><span></span>Slowly looking all around
<br/><span></span>“He’s an outlaw loose and running”
<br/><span></span>Came the whisper from each lip
<br/><span></span>“And he’s here to do some business
<br/><span></span>With the big iron on his hip”
<br/><span></span>Big iron on his hip<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>In this town there lived an outlaw
<br/><span></span>By the name of Texas Red
<br/><span></span>Many men had tried to take him
<br/><span></span>And that many men were dead
<br/><span></span>He was vicious and a killer
<br/><span></span>Though a youth of twenty-four
<br/><span></span>And the notches on his pistol
<br/><span></span>Numbered one and nineteen more
<br/><span></span>One and nineteen more<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>Now the stranger started talking
<br/><span></span>Made it plain to folks around
<br/><span></span>Was an Arizona Ranger
<br/><span></span>Wouldn’t be too long in town
<br/><span></span>He came here to take an outlaw
<br/><span></span>Back alive, or maybe dead
<br/><span></span>And he said it didn’t matter
<br/><span></span>He was after Texas Red
<br/><span></span>After Texas Red<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>Wasn’t long before the story
<br/><span></span>Was relayed to Texas Red
<br/><span></span>But the outlaw didn’t worry
<br/><span></span>Men that tried before were dead
<br/><span></span>Twenty men had tried to take him
<br/><span></span>Twenty men had made a slip
<br/><span></span>Twenty-one would be the Ranger
<br/><span></span>With the big iron on his hip
<br/><span></span>Big iron on his hip<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>The morning passed so quickly
<br/><span></span>It was time for them to meet
<br/><span></span>It was twenty past eleven
<br/><span></span>When they walked out in the street
<br/><span></span>Folks were watching from the windows
<br/><span></span>Everybody held their breath
<br/><span></span>They knew this handsome Ranger
<br/><span></span>Was about to meet his death
<br/><span></span>’Bout to meet his death<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>There was forty feet between them
<br/><span></span>When they stopped to make their play
<br/><span></span>And the swiftness of the Ranger
<br/><span></span>Is still talked about today
<br/><span></span>Texas Red had not cleared leather
<br/><span></span>’Fore a bullet fairly ripped
<br/><span></span>And the Ranger’s aim was deadly
<br/><span></span>With the big iron on his hip
<br/><span></span>Big iron on his hip<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>It was over in a moment
<br/><span></span>And the folks had gathered round
<br/><span></span>There before them lay the body
<br/><span></span>Of the outlaw on the ground
<br/><span></span>Oh, he might have went on livin’
<br/><span></span>But he made one fatal slip
<br/><span></span>When he tried to match the Ranger
<br/><span></span>With the big iron on his hip
<br/><span></span>Big iron on his hip<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>Big iron, big iron
<br/><span></span>When he tried to match the Ranger
<br/><span></span>With the big iron on his hip
<br/><span></span>Big iron on his hip<br/><span></span><br/><span></span><br></div><hr><table><tbody><tr><td>Song name&nbsp;</td><td>Big Iron</td><tr><td>Artist&nbsp;</td><td>Marty Robbins</td><tr><td>Album&nbsp;</td><td>Gunfighter Ballads and Trail Songs</td><tr><td>Track number&nbsp;</td><td>1</td><tr><td>Year&nbsp;</td><td>1959</td><tr><td>Language&nbsp;</td><td>American English</td></tbody></table><div id="lyrics-actions"><a href="https://github.com/Lyrics/lyrics-database/edit/master/database/M/Marty Robbins/Gunfighter Ballads and Trail Songs/Big Iron">Suggest improvements for this text</a><br></div></div></div></div><script>var i=document.createElement("input");i.name="q";i.type="search";i.placeholder="Search";document.forms[0].firstChild.appendChild(i)</script>
