<br/><span></span>His brother at his side screaming "This isn’t your fight."
<br/><span></span>But that rush took over his head and he came to his mother’s side.
<br/><span></span>And he found himself alone with that devil rambling.
<br/><span></span>"Oh, well the money’s all gone and she can’t pay the rent with that needle in her arm."
<br/><span></span>He clenched his fists.
<br/><span></span>"What did she ever do to you, but raise us by herself when you were too drunk to come through?"
<br/><span></span>He took a swing.
<br/><span></span>"That’s some nerve you got kid."
<br/><span></span>"Yeah, well they’ll put that on your tombstone as the last thing that you said. I never wanted to kill a man, like i want to kill you, man."
<br/><span></span>The years of pain boiled over, trading blows across the counter.
<br/><span></span>And when that devil was down he grabbed for his empty old friend Jack.
<br/><span></span>He caught his eye as he took his last breath and that vice went to his head again and again.
<br/><span></span>"Dear God, what have you done?" cried out his mother.
<br/><span></span>"That devil drunk was no father. Another name on a list for unpaid bookies and gambling debts."
<br/><span></span>That spiteful stare of his brother.
<br/><span></span>"I ain’t no forgiver or forgetter. I’ll make you pay for this when you least expect it."
<br/><span></span>He washed the blood from his hands, kissed his mother and stepped into cold night air.<br/><span></span><br/><span></span><br/></div><hr/><table><tbody><tr><td>Song name&nbsp;</td><td>Forgiver Forgetter</td><tr><td>Artist&nbsp;</td><td>Defeater</td><tr><td>Album&nbsp;</td><td>Travels</td></tbody></table><div id="lyrics-actions"><a href="https://github.com/Lyrics/lyrics/edit/master/database/D/Defeater/Travels/Forgiver Forgetter">Suggest improvements for this text</a></div></div></div></div><script>var i=document.createElement("input");i.name="q";i.type="search";i.placeholder="Search";document.forms[0].firstChild.appendChild(i)</script>
