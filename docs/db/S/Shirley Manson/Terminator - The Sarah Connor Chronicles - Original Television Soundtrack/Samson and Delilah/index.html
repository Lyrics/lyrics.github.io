<br/><span></span>If I had my way
<br/><span></span>I’d burn this whole building down<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>Delilah was a woman, she was fine and fair
<br/><span></span>She had good looks and coal black hair
<br/><span></span>Delilah, she gained ground on Samson’s mind
<br/><span></span>When he saw this woman, she looked so fine
<br/><span></span>Delilah, she climbed up on Samson’s knee
<br/><span></span>Said, “tell me where your strength lies, if you please”
<br/><span></span>Then she spoke so kind and she talked so fair
<br/><span></span>Till Samson said, “Delilah, cut off my hair
<br/><span></span>You can shave my head clean as my hand
<br/><span></span>And my strength becomes as natural as any man”<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>If I had my way

<br/><span></span>He was the strongest man that ever lived on earth
<br/><span></span>One day while Samson’s walking, walking alone
<br/><span></span>Looked down on the ground and saw an old jawbone
<br/><span></span>And he stretched out his arms and his chains broke like thread
<br/><span></span>When he got to move, ten thousand men was dead<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>If I had my way
<br/><span></span>If I had my way
<br/><span></span>If I had my way
<br/><span></span>I’d burn this whole building down
<br/><span></span>If I had my way (if I had my way)
<br/><span></span>If I had my way (if I had my way)
<br/><span></span>If I had my way
<br/><span></span>I’d burn this building down<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>Little Samson and the lion got entwined in a fight
<br/><span></span>And Samson, he jumped up and took on the lion’s might
<br/><span></span>You all know just how a lion can kill a man with his paws
<br/><span></span>Well, Samson got his hands up round that lion’s jaws
<br/><span></span>And he ripped that beast and he killed him dead
<br/><span></span>And the bees made honey in the lion’s head<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>If I had my way
<br/><span></span>If I had my way
<br/><span></span>If I had my way
