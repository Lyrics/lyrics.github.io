<br/><span></span>And clouds made of fire
<br/><span></span>And mountains stretched up
<br/><span></span>To the sky, sometimes higher
<br/><span></span>Folks roamed the Earth like big rolling kegs
<br/><span></span>They had two sets of arms, they had two sets of legs
<br/><span></span>They had two faces peering out of one giant head
<br/><span></span>So they could watch all around them as they talked while they read
<br/><span></span>And they never knew nothing of love, it was before, oh
<br/><span></span>The origin of love (origin of love)
<br/><span></span>The origin of love (origin of love)<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>Now there was three sexes then, one that looked like two men glued up back-to-back
<br/><span></span>They called “the children of the Sun”
<br/><span></span>And similar in shape and girth was “the children of the Earth”, they looked like
<br/><span></span>Two girls rolled up in one
<br/><span></span>And “the children of the Moon”
<br/><span></span>Was like a fork shoved on a spoon
<br/><span></span>They was part-Sun, part-Earth, part-daughter, part-son
<br/><span></span>Pa-la-la-la, the origin of love<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>Now the gods grew quite scared of our strength and defiance
<br/><span></span>And Thor said, “I’m gonna kill them all with my hammer like I killed the giants”
<br/><span></span>But Zeus said, “No, you better let me use my lightning like scissors,
<br/><span></span>like I cut the legs off the whales, dinosaurs into lizards”
<br/><span></span>And then he grabbed up some bolts, he let out a laugh
<br/><span></span>Said, “I’ll split them right down the middle, gonna cut them right up in half”
<br/><span></span>And the storm clouds gathered above
<br/><span></span>Into great balls of fire…
<br/><span></span>And then fire shot down from the sky in bolts like shining blades of a knife
<br/><span></span>And it ripped right through the flesh of the children of the Sun and the Moon and the Earth
<br/><span></span>And some Indian god sewed the wound up into a hole
<br/><span></span>Pulled it ’round to our bellies to remind us the price we paid
<br/><span></span>And Osiris and the gods of the Nile gathered up a big storm
<br/><span></span>To blow a hurricane
<br/><span></span>To scatter us away
<br/><span></span>In a flood of wind and rain
<br/><span></span>And sea of tidal waves
<br/><span></span>To wash us all away
<br/><span></span>And if we don’t behave
<br/><span></span>They’ll cut us down again
<br/><span></span>And we’ll be hopping around on one foot
<br/><span></span>And looking through one eye<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>Last time I saw you, we just split in two
<br/><span></span>You was looking at me, I was looking at you
<br/><span></span>You had a way so familiar I could not recognize
<br/><span></span>’Cause you had blood on your face, I had blood in my eyes
<br/><span></span>But I could swear by your expression
<br/><span></span>That the pain down in your soul was the same
<br/><span></span>As the one down in mine
<br/><span></span>That’s the pain
<br/><span></span>That cuts a straight line down through the heart
<br/><span></span>We call it “love”
<br/><span></span>We wrapped our arms around each other
<br/><span></span>Trying to shove ourselves back together
<br/><span></span>We was making love, making love
<br/><span></span>It was a cold dark evening such a long time ago
<br/><span></span>When by the mighty hand of Jove
<br/><span></span>It was a sad story how we became lonely two-legged creatures
<br/><span></span>That story, the origin of love, that’s the origin of love (oh yeah)
<br/><span></span>The origin of love
<br/><span></span>The origin of love
<br/><span></span>The origin of love…<br/><span></span><br/><span></span><br></div><hr><table><tbody><tr><td>Song name&nbsp;</td><td>Origin of Love</td><tr><td>Artist&nbsp;</td><td>Stephen Trask,  John Cameron Mitchell</td><tr><td>Album&nbsp;</td><td>Hedwig and the Angry Inch: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack</td><tr><td>Track number&nbsp;</td><td>2</td><tr><td>Year&nbsp;</td><td>2001</td><tr><td>Language&nbsp;</td><td>American English</td></tbody></table><div id="lyrics-actions"><a href="https://github.com/Lyrics/lyrics-database/edit/master/database/S/Stephen Trask/Hedwig and the Angry Inch - Original Motion Picture Soundtrack/Origin of Love">Suggest improvements for this text</a><br></div></div></div></div><script>const i=document.createElement("input");i.name="q";i.type="search";i.placeholder="Search";document.forms[0].firstChild.appendChild(i)</script>
