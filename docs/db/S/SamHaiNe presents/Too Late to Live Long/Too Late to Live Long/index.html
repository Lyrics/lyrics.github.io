<br/><span></span>With jagged teeth complimenting pins, turning obstructions into openings.
<br/><span></span>He’d made it.
<br/><span></span>Stale air, humid smells, gnats in the kitchen.
<br/><span></span>He’s yawning in the living room, throwing his clothes into the corner with no time, no time at all, none to waste, none to lose.
<br/><span></span>Thunderstorms and more closing in. But, there’s no more, no distractions, no time.
<br/><span></span>Gotta move, gotta focus.<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>The handcuff marks around his wrists are itching.<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>He ignores the late notice on his "Welcome" mat.
<br/><span></span>He grabs a backpack and empties what he needs from the dresser: ready to eat meals, ramen, the necessities.
<br/><span></span>The setup on his work desk is too impractical to travel. He’ll leave that for last.<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>Broadcasting on one of his monitors is police dispatch:
<br/><span></span>"Suspect escaped. White male, 5'10", dark hair. Last seen on Oak and Spruce".<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>Looks like Frank lost them back at the train station.
<br/><span></span>Gives him some extra breathing time.<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>He sees a rat eating the sandwich he left on the TV table.
<br/><span></span>"Fucking rats -- you let one live and they’ll ruin everything."<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>He takes a hammer and slams the rodent’s head with a crunching sound like crackers in a napkin.<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>He sits down and looks over his monitors and closes some accounts and transfers some Bitcoin into a proxy he had reserved in case of emergencies.<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>Frank had been pinched earlier downtown by Oak trying to trade some vials of melanin for a few film reels of sketchy interactions between certain persons of influence and faces of media during one of those "fundraising parties at Bilderberg".<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>The client was superstitious and paranoid so, they met in person with analog material in hand.
<br/><span></span>Sounded just fine to Franco. Physical contraband had more value in its fragility. No fuss, no counterfeit, no malware, no bugs, no viruses.
<br/><span></span>Frank’s work was commerce and customer service. Illicit materials bought, traded, sold like baseball cards.
<br/><span></span>When he wasn’t some deep web "Crazy Eddie", he’d mine Bitcoin from a warehouse under a phony name.<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>The client delivered and as soon as he could touch the envelope, Frank was surrounded by ten guns and nine badges.<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>Should’ve never left the ’Ville. Spooks were probably on the hunt for the film or maybe his hustle; but they couldn’t raid the ’Ville.
<br/><span></span>Regardless of that, the common denominator was this rat-faced fuck who set him up.<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>So the screws roughed him up and Frank called them every which thing but Lucy: "Motherfuckers, Pig Cunts, Shit Micks, Freckled-Kiks, Spic-Fuck-Dog-Faced-Niggers", the whole lexicon of insults he could sweat between his teeth.<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>They tossed him into the paddy wagon, cuffed from behind and slammed the door. And he slid around into both sides of the van with every wild and on-purpose turn on the highway.<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>Fortunately, Frank kept a handcuff key tucked up in his gums and got loose.
<br/><span></span>Then he slipped out whatever needed hidden in his sneaker soles and popped the backdoor open, jumping from a vehicle going 65mph and making a break for it.<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>Frank woke up the girl who was still passed out on his bed.
<br/><span></span>"Get your shit in bag and split", he said. Pushing her out the door and tossing her things into the stairwell.<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>She calls him a, "piece of shit, dickless, computer nerd who can’t fuck anyways".<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>Frank gets his go-bag and waits for the bitch to leave the premises. Hoping - no one paid attention to some cracked out whore in the building.<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>Nothing. Good.<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>Frank showers after destroying all his files, CDs, hardware, and burning everything analog and paperwork in the apartment. Cold shower calmed him.
<br/><span></span>He sits on the sofa with his bag on his lap and listens to the rain.
<br/><span></span>"Don’t rest, gotta go. Stay on point. Focused. Get on your feet. Maybe a few seconds. Clock’s ticking, running out. No more sand, wind and rain. Stay focused. Breathe. No time."
<br/><span></span>Franky nods out.<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>When he opens his eyes an hour has past. Still alive. Still free. A little relaxed, rested.
<br/><span></span>He slings the strap of his bag over his shoulders and…<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>Frank staggers to his feet. Stays quiet. He’ll fake ’em out.
<br/><span></span>They’ll take the bait and move on.
<br/><span></span>The adrenaline roaring through his body and ringing in his ears.
<br/><span></span>He’s hoping they’ll see the fake name on the entrance and think twice then move on.
<br/><span></span>He stays quiet but they keep knocking.
<br/><span></span>Then he hears another voice, "Frank! Frank open up the door!"
<br/><span></span>"Yea, he’s still in there. Frank Welling, that piece of shit."<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>Frank shakes his head.
<br/><span></span>It’s the fucking whore he short changed an hour earlier.
<br/><span></span>She somehow found the cops; heard the broadcast.
<br/><span></span>Either way, she brought the pigs to his fucking door.
<br/><span></span>"Fucking rats -- you let one go and they’ll ruin your life."<br/><span></span><br/><span></span><br/></div><hr/><table><tbody><tr><td>Song name&nbsp;</td><td>Too Late to Live Long</td><tr><td>Artist&nbsp;</td><td>SamHaiNe</td><tr><td>Original text by&nbsp;</td><td>Sam Haine</td></tbody></table><div id="lyrics-actions"><a href="https://github.com/Lyrics/lyrics/edit/master/database/S/SamHaiNe presents/Too Late to Live Long/Too Late to Live Long">Suggest improvements for this text</a></div></div></div></div><script>var i=document.createElement("input");i.name="q";i.type="search";i.placeholder="Search";document.forms[0].firstChild.appendChild(i)</script>
