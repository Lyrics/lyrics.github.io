<br/><span></span>I was not caught across the line
<br/><span></span>I was not caught, though many tried
<br/><span></span>I live among you, well-disguised<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>I had to leave my life behind
<br/><span></span>I dug some graves you’ll never find
<br/><span></span>The story’s told with facts and lies
<br/><span></span>I had a name, but never mind<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>Never mind, never mind
<br/><span></span>The war was lost, the treaty signed
<br/><span></span>There’s truth that lives and truth that dies
<br/><span></span>I don’t know which, so never mind<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>Your victory was so complete
<br/><span></span>Some among you thought to keep
<br/><span></span>A record of our little lives
<br/><span></span>The clothes we wore, our spoons, our knives<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>The games of luck our soldiers played
<br/><span></span>The stones we cut, the songs we made
<br/><span></span>Our law of peace which understands
<br/><span></span>A husband leads, a wife commands<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>And all of these expressions of
<br/><span></span>The sweet indifference, some called "love"
<br/><span></span>The high indifference, some call "fate"
<br/><span></span>But we had names more intimate<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>Names so deep and names so true
<br/><span></span>They’re blood to me, they’re dust to you
<br/><span></span>There is no need that this survives
<br/><span></span>There’s truth that lives and truth that dies<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>Never mind, never mind
<br/><span></span>I leave the life, I left behind
<br/><span></span>There’s truth that lives and truth that dies
<br/><span></span>I don’t know which, so never mind<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>I could not kill the way you kill, I could not hate
<br/><span></span>I tried, I failed
<br/><span></span>You turned me in, at least you tried
<br/><span></span>You side with them whom you despise<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>This was your heart, this swarm of flies
<br/><span></span>This was once your mouth, this bowl of lies
<br/><span></span>You serve them well, I’m not surprised
<br/><span></span>You’re of their kin, you’re of their kind<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>Never mind, never mind
<br/><span></span>I had to leave my life behind
<br/><span></span>The story’s told with facts and lies
<br/><span></span>You own the world, so never mind<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>Never mind, never mind
<br/><span></span>I live the life I left behind
<br/><span></span>I live it full, I live it wide
<br/><span></span>Through layers of time you can’t divide<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>My woman’s here, my children, too
<br/><span></span>Their graves are safe from ghosts like you
<br/><span></span>In places deep, with roots entwined
<br/><span></span>I live the life I left behind<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>The war was lost, the treaty signed
<br/><span></span>I was not caught across the line
<br/><span></span>I was not caught, though many tried
