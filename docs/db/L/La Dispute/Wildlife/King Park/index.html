<br/><span></span>This a drive-by, mid-day
<br/><span></span>Outside of the bus stop
<br/><span></span>By Fuller and Franklin, or near there
<br/><span></span>Not far from the park
<br/><span></span>About a block from where
<br/><span></span>The other shooting was last month
<br/><span></span>Or was it last week?<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>Shots were fired from an SUV
<br/><span></span>Heading northbound, Eastown
<br/><span></span>The target, a rival
<br/><span></span>But they didn’t hit the target this time
<br/><span></span>They hit a kid we think
<br/><span></span>Had nothing to do with it<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>And I travel backwards
<br/><span></span>Through time and space, and
<br/><span></span>I disintegrate, become invisible
<br/><span></span>I want to see it
<br/><span></span>Where I couldn’t when it happened
<br/><span></span>I want to see it all
<br/><span></span>First hand this time
<br/><span></span>I want to know what it felt like<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>So I float behind police lines
<br/><span></span>Reconstruct the scene in fragments of memories
<br/><span></span>I want to know what his mother looked like up close
<br/><span></span>I want to see her leaning over his body
<br/><span></span>So I float there, transcend time
<br/><span></span>I want to capture it accurately
<br/><span></span>I want to know what the color of the blood was
<br/><span></span>Spilling out from the tarp onto the concrete<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>I want to write it all down
<br/><span></span>So I can always remember
<br/><span></span>If you could see it up close
<br/><span></span>How could you ever forget
<br/><span></span>How senseless death
<br/><span></span>How precious life
<br/><span></span>I want to be there
<br/><span></span>When the bullet hit<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>And the crowd poured out
<br/><span></span>As the shots drowned
<br/><span></span>Into siren sounds
<br/><span></span>Out of their houses now
<br/><span></span>And over front yards
<br/><span></span>All the way up to the place
<br/><span></span>Where the police tape ran
<br/><span></span>To mark the crime scene<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>Everybody trying to catch a glimpse
<br/><span></span>Of what was happening, of what was going on
<br/><span></span>Between the ambulance, and all the cop cars
<br/><span></span>Everybody gossiping, "Whose kid got hit?
<br/><span></span>Where’d it hit him, and who could’ve fired it?"
<br/><span></span>Everybody wondering, "How did it happen again?
<br/><span></span>And is he dead? These children, our kids"<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>Everybody wondering how far they were
<br/><span></span>From where the victims lived
<br/><span></span>And I visit them, their houses
<br/><span></span>Inside my dream I visit them
<br/><span></span>My spirit, soaring high and high
<br/><span></span>Up over King Park, leaves the crime scene
<br/><span></span>Travels further back, till far before the shooting
<br/><span></span>Through their windows, to their living rooms<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>I see them younger this time
<br/><span></span>Playing games and doing homework
<br/><span></span>All these marks of youth
<br/><span></span>Soon transformed coldly into stone
<br/><span></span>For fights and stupid feuds
<br/><span></span>For ruins wrapped in gold, and<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>Cruelly, I recall
<br/><span></span>Why I have come
<br/><span></span>To find a reason
<br/><span></span>But there cannot be a reason
<br/><span></span>Not for death, not like this
<br/><span></span>Not like this<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>Three days later, they made funeral plans
<br/><span></span>The family
<br/><span></span>Three days later, a mother
<br/><span></span>Had to bury her son<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>Not far away, the shooter
<br/><span></span>Holed up in a hotel
<br/><span></span>Near to the highway
<br/><span></span>With a friend and the gun
<br/><span></span>That same gun<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>He’d fled immediately
<br/><span></span>But was identified by witnesses
<br/><span></span>His picture on TV
<br/><span></span>Only 20 years old; they called him Grandpa
<br/><span></span>He was older than the others
<br/><span></span>By a year, maybe two, and
<br/><span></span>He was safe for awhile
<br/><span></span>Until somebody saw him there<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>And notified the authorities
<br/><span></span>Who surrounded the hotel
<br/><span></span>First arresting an accomplice
<br/><span></span>While attempting to flee
<br/><span></span>Then chasing him up the staircase
<br/><span></span>To the floor where he’d stayed
<br/><span></span>He closed the door hard behind him
<br/><span></span>Locked himself in the room<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>They could’ve kicked in the door
<br/><span></span>But knew the gun was still with him
<br/><span></span>One he’d already used
<br/><span></span>And so they feared what he’d do
<br/><span></span>I floated up through the window
<br/><span></span>Of a room to the west
<br/><span></span>I hovered out to the hallway
<br/><span></span>Tried to listen in<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>I heard them trying to reason
<br/><span></span>Get him to open the door
<br/><span></span>His uncle begging and pleading
<br/><span></span>Half-collapsed to the floor
<br/><span></span>He preached of hope and forgiveness
<br/><span></span>Said, "There is always a chance
<br/><span></span>To rectify what you’ve taken
<br/><span></span>Make your peace in the world"<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>I thought to slip through the door
<br/><span></span>I could’ve entered the room
<br/><span></span>I felt the burden of murder
<br/><span></span>It shook the earth to the core
<br/><span></span>Felt like the world was collapsing
<br/><span></span>Then we heard him speak<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>"Can I still get into heaven if I kill myself?
<br/><span></span>Can I still get into heaven if I kill myself?
<br/><span></span>Can I ever be forgiven cause I killed that kid?
<br/><span></span>It was an accident, I swear it wasn’t meant for him!<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>And if I turn it on me, if I even it out
<br/><span></span>Can I still get in or will they send me to hell?
<br/><span></span>Can I still get into heaven if I kill myself?"
<br/><span></span>I left the hotel behind, don’t want to know how it ends<br/><span></span><br/><span></span><br></div><hr><table><tbody><tr><td>Song name&nbsp;</td><td>King Park</td><tr><td>Artist&nbsp;</td><td>La Dispute</td><tr><td>Album&nbsp;</td><td>Wildlife</td></tbody></table><div id="lyrics-actions"><a href="https://github.com/Lyrics/lyrics-database/edit/master/database/L/La Dispute/Wildlife/King Park">Suggest improvements for this text</a><br></div></div></div></div><script>var i=document.createElement("input");i.name="q";i.type="search";i.placeholder="Search";document.forms[0].firstChild.appendChild(i)</script>
