<br/><span></span>Brush against my arm
<br/><span></span>As I walked by you
<br/><span></span>Heard your voice but
<br/><span></span>Couldn’t tell that it was you<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>And slowly
<br/><span></span>Watched your sickness slip away
<br/><span></span>Into a place
<br/><span></span>That I’d once feared, but I
<br/><span></span>Was not afraid this time<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>So I gave chase and found it, finally
<br/><span></span>Slowly feeding from your head
<br/><span></span>And from my friends, and from my family
<br/><span></span>So I grabbed it by the neck<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>"For every lover you have ruined…;"
<br/><span></span>I dug my nails into its flesh
<br/><span></span>"…;and every life that you have taken"
<br/><span></span>Slammed its head against the brick<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>Its blood poured out onto the pavement
<br/><span></span>I stirred it in with dirt and spit
<br/><span></span>"I will take a part of you"
<br/><span></span>I made mortar from the mix<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>Tore every organ from its body
<br/><span></span>Broke its bone and fashioned bricks
<br/><span></span>I laid the mortar in between
<br/><span></span>I made a throne for hope to sit<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>"Too long you’ve torn us into pieces
<br/><span></span>Firmly held onto our wrists
<br/><span></span>Today I bury you in me"
<br/><span></span>I swallowed every inch of it<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>I’ll
<br/><span></span>I’ll hold you
<br/><span></span>As you have held me
<br/><span></span>You’ve held me in your heart<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>We’ll be
<br/><span></span>We’ll be set free from
<br/><span></span>We’ll be set free from
<br/><span></span>Fear, we’ll be set free<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>Oh we’ve felt our failures
<br/><span></span>We’ve watched our passions
<br/><span></span>Leave, but we’re still breathing
<br/><span></span>Oh but we’re still beating on<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>I’ll
<br/><span></span>I’ll hold you
<br/><span></span>As you have held me
<br/><span></span>You’ve held me in your heart<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>(And I will hold you in my heart)<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>But I still see him
<br/><span></span>Dead in the parking lot
<br/><span></span>At the gas station just down the street<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>And I still hear my friend say
<br/><span></span>"You know, you wouldn’t believe the things
<br/><span></span>I saw when I was stationed overseas"<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>But he somehow keeps smiling
<br/><span></span>In spite all of that
<br/><span></span>While I keep finding ways
<br/><span></span>To push the good out for the bad<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>Oh how selfish of myself
<br/><span></span>To always say that it was
<br/><span></span>More than I could take
<br/><span></span>Like it was pain I couldn’t shake
<br/><span></span>Like it could break me with its fingers
<br/><span></span>Throw my body in the lake
<br/><span></span>And I would slowly sink away<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>But the truth is, it was sorrow
<br/><span></span>That I made
<br/><span></span>And wouldn’t face
<br/><span></span>See, I keep falling for the future
<br/><span></span>After tripping on the past
<br/><span></span>And I am always tearing sutures out
<br/><span></span>To make the anguish last<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>Like it defines me
<br/><span></span>Or reminds me
<br/><span></span>I’ve found comfort in my suffering
<br/><span></span>And uncertainty in happiness and death
<br/><span></span>Because what’s next is such a mystery to me
<br/><span></span>And I am terrified of all the things
<br/><span></span>I feel but cannot see<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>Friends and family
<br/><span></span>Put your hand into my hand
<br/><span></span>And lay your head into my chest
<br/><span></span>You are all that I have left here
<br/><span></span>We are all that we have left<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>We are the lovers
<br/><span></span>We are the last of our kind
<br/><span></span>So link your arms and keep your chin up
<br/><span></span>And I swear that we’ll be fine<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>We are the lovers
<br/><span></span>We are the last of our kind<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>Though we are not sure who we are
<br/><span></span>We keep our heads up
<br/><span></span>Though we are not sure where we’re from
<br/><span></span>We keep our hearts up
<br/><span></span>Though we are not sure when we’ll leave
<br/><span></span>We keep our heads up
<br/><span></span>Though we are not sure where we’ll go
<br/><span></span>We keep our hopes up<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>Though we’re not sure who we are
<br/><span></span>We keep our heads up
<br/><span></span>Though we’re not sure where we’re from
<br/><span></span>We keep our hearts up
<br/><span></span>Though we’re not sure when we’ll leave
<br/><span></span>We keep our heads up
<br/><span></span>Though we’re not sure where we’ll go
<br/><span></span>We keep our hopes up<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>Keep your head up
<br/><span></span>We’re fine
<br/><span></span>Just keep your head up
<br/><span></span>I swear we’ll be alright<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>Keep your head up
<br/><span></span>My friends, my friends
<br/><span></span>Keep your head up
<br/><span></span>I swear<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>I swear we’ll never die, I swear
<br/><span></span>We’ll get home safe and sound, I swear
<br/><span></span>I swear we’ll never die, I swear
<br/><span></span>We’ll live on underground, I swear<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>I will give your heart a place to rest
<br/><span></span>When everything you had has turned and left<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>I’ll weave your names into my ribcage
<br/><span></span>Lock your hearts inside my chest
<br/><span></span>Regain the passion I once carried
<br/><span></span>Do away with all the rest<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>I tore the sickness from your bodies
<br/><span></span>Smashed its head against the bricks
<br/><span></span>I made a castle from its bones
<br/><span></span>That you may always dwell in it<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>So sing for every buried moment
<br/><span></span>That you’d thought would never end
<br/><span></span>And sing your fears about the future
<br/><span></span>And a dirge for faded friends<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>For all the love that you had held to
<br/><span></span>Why it somehow failed to keep
<br/><span></span>And sing each minute you’ve been frightened
<br/><span></span>Every hour that you’ve lost sleep<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>And sing for all your friends and family
<br/><span></span>Sing for those who didn’t survive
<br/><span></span>But sing not for their final outcome
<br/><span></span>Sing a song of how they tried<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>We live amidst a violent storm
<br/><span></span>Leaves us unsatisfied at best
<br/><span></span>So fill your hearts with what’s important
<br/><span></span>And be done with all the rest<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>We are what’s left of what we once were
<br/><span></span>We are falling far behind
<br/><span></span>There’s so much stacking up against us
<br/><span></span>And we’re running out of time<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>We are but hopeful children
<br/><span></span>And we’re the last of our kind
<br/><span></span>But if we let our hearts move outward
<br/><span></span>I know we will never<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>We are but friends and family
<br/><span></span>We are the last of our kind
<br/><span></span>So hold my hand, I’ll lift your head up
<br/><span></span>And I promise we’ll be fine<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>We are but hopeful lovers
<br/><span></span>And we are running out of time
<br/><span></span>There’s so much stacking up against us
<br/><span></span>And we’re falling far behind<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>We are but hopeful lovers
<br/><span></span>We are the last of our kind
<br/><span></span>But if we let our hearts move outward
<br/><span></span>I know we will never<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>We are but lovers
<br/><span></span>We are the last of our kind
<br/><span></span>And if we let our hearts move outward
<br/><span></span>I know we will never<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>We are but lovers
<br/><span></span>We are the last of our kind
<br/><span></span>And if we let our hearts move outward
