<br/><span></span>Eye your uncomfortable pose in profile
<br/><span></span>The postures of long drives
<br/><span></span>That endless cycling of your numb and near sleeping parts<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>And you lean much harder than you need
<br/><span></span>When the road curves
<br/><span></span>Swerve through traffic
<br/><span></span>And the cracks in the ground
<br/><span></span>Every gesture you require
<br/><span></span>Of a drive like this night
<br/><span></span>When you fight now
<br/><span></span>You just head out of town<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>I let the wheel go
<br/><span></span>Over center lines
<br/><span></span>Inside a place without time
<br/><span></span>A loop through history
<br/><span></span>Eye you in periphery
<br/><span></span>Now prone in the passenger seat
<br/><span></span>It’s a mystery
<br/><span></span>The ways you can sleep<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>I want to leave here
<br/><span></span>For where nobody goes
<br/><span></span>I want to breathe in the air of all
<br/><span></span>Those sprawling ancient spaces on earth
<br/><span></span>You said we’re so scared of alone
<br/><span></span>And I knew what you meant
<br/><span></span>You want to go where it glows
<br/><span></span>All those places where your watch doesn’t work<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>You were riding those nights
<br/><span></span>On the highway, always hiding out
<br/><span></span>Inside a songwriter’s dream there
<br/><span></span>Like a scene from a song
<br/><span></span>"Born to Run" or maybe "Running on Empty"<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>Ones where they would leave
<br/><span></span>Certain nights when you’d fight
<br/><span></span>You couldn’t stick around
<br/><span></span>So you’d head out of town
<br/><span></span>Just hit the highway and drive
<br/><span></span>Certain nights when you’d thought it was fine
<br/><span></span>But it shook you when the baby would cry<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>Why did you always turn around in the end?
<br/><span></span>To hear the shattering of glass on the door again?
<br/><span></span>So loud the baby couldn’t sleep any more?
<br/><span></span>What didn’t you find that you were looking for?<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>Your mother called a hardware
<br/><span></span>Set you up an interview
<br/><span></span>An answer to an ad
<br/><span></span>The bosses’ daughter still remembers dinner where her father
<br/><span></span>Said he wouldn’t stick his neck out for trouble again<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>But they did then
<br/><span></span>And those days you’d wake up
<br/><span></span>And just decide you wouldn’t show
<br/><span></span>He’d show up at your door
<br/><span></span>Nights you’d skip town
<br/><span></span>He’d follow you out
<br/><span></span>Pretty soon you started falling for their daughter
<br/><span></span>And she fell for you<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>Drive, roll every window down
<br/><span></span>Let the desert enter, heavy and primitive in
<br/><span></span>Drift ’til rumble strips sound
<br/><span></span>Time moves so slow but I know
<br/><span></span>That you meant what you said
<br/><span></span>You want to go where it’s frozen
<br/><span></span>All those places where the highways don’t reach<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>You want to go where it glows
<br/><span></span>Somewhere that time is irrelevant
<br/><span></span>You want to go where it glows
<br/><span></span>Somewhere the spaces are infinite<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>You want to go where it glows
<br/><span></span>Somewhere you don’t feel the hours pass by
<br/><span></span>You identified the flowers on the road
<br/><span></span>I rolled the windows down and shut off the radio<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>Did you ever think you’d end up here?
<br/><span></span>All those late nights you were driving alone?
<br/><span></span>You were riding to hide
<br/><span></span>Or you were looking for a brand new life
<br/><span></span>Did you ever think you’d find one back home?<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>Did you even think you’d get out alive?
<br/><span></span>Could you imagine then, the love you now know?<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>I think history’s a system of roads
<br/><span></span>And there’s nowhere it doesn’t go<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>I pulled over to the side and felt no time
<br/><span></span>Off the highway with the landscape aglow
<br/><span></span>Still not sure what we were trying to find
<br/><span></span>I only know we went home<br/><span></span><br/><span></span><br></div><hr><table><tbody><tr><td>Song name&nbsp;</td><td>SCENES FROM HIGHWAYS 1981-2009</td><tr><td>Artist&nbsp;</td><td>La Dispute</td><tr><td>Album&nbsp;</td><td>Rooms of the House</td></tbody></table><div id="lyrics-actions"><a href="https://github.com/Lyrics/lyrics-database/edit/master/database/L/La Dispute/Rooms of the House/SCENES FROM HIGHWAYS 1981-2009">Suggest improvements for this text</a><br></div></div></div></div><script>const i=document.createElement("input");i.name="q";i.type="search";i.placeholder="Search";document.forms[0].firstChild.appendChild(i)</script></html>
