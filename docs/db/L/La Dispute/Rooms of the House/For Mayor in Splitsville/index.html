<br/><span></span>While lying in the dirt
<br/><span></span>The first thing that comes back
<br/><span></span>Is never quite what you’d have guessed
<br/><span></span>And if you could have
<br/><span></span>You probably would’ve said you’d check
<br/><span></span>If all your limbs were intact
<br/><span></span>Still and then try to get out<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>We played house with the
<br/><span></span>Neighbors in their basement
<br/><span></span>Sister made me husband
<br/><span></span>She was older so I did her bidding
<br/><span></span>I remember once their dad came in
<br/><span></span>And said, "You think this is bad?
<br/><span></span>You don’t know the half"
<br/><span></span>And he laughed<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>It’s funny what things come back
<br/><span></span>The first things you see<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>How he sort of smiled
<br/><span></span>Like it’s only a joke, but he was lying
<br/><span></span>There was something else inside of his eyes
<br/><span></span>All those secrets people tell to little children
<br/><span></span>Are warnings that they give them
<br/><span></span>Like, "Look, I’m unhappy
<br/><span></span>Please don’t make the same mistake as me"<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>Why are those old worn out jokes
<br/><span></span>On married life told at toasts
<br/><span></span>At receptions still?<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>How does it never occur
<br/><span></span>How often couples get burned
<br/><span></span>And end uncertain in Splitsville?<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>Funny what you think of in the wreckage
<br/><span></span>Lying there in the dirt and the dust and the glass
<br/><span></span>How you’re suddenly somewhere
<br/><span></span>In the desert, in the night time
<br/><span></span>And it’s gettin’ close to Christmas
<br/><span></span>And then her and that movie voice she uses when she reads
<br/><span></span>"Welcome to the Land of Enchantment" from a highway sign
<br/><span></span>And it’s late so you take the next exit<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>When that trip ended, we came back
<br/><span></span>The rent was due, I was jobless
<br/><span></span>I guess in retrospect, I should’ve sensed decay
<br/><span></span>Then that day, how you said
<br/><span></span>"I just don’t know" and I promised
<br/><span></span>We’d rearrange things
<br/><span></span>Ro fix the mess I’d made here<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>But I guess in the end
<br/><span></span>We just moved furniture around
<br/><span></span>But I guess in the end
<br/><span></span>We just moved furniture around
<br/><span></span>But I guess in the end
<br/><span></span>We just moved furniture around
<br/><span></span>But I guess in the end<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>It sort of feels like every day it’s harder
<br/><span></span>To stay happy where you are
<br/><span></span>There are all these ways to look through the fence
<br/><span></span>Into your neighbor’s yard<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>Why even risk it?
<br/><span></span>It’s safer to stay distant
<br/><span></span>When it’s so hard now to just be content
<br/><span></span>Because there’s always something else<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>Now I’m proposing my own toast
<br/><span></span>Composing my own joke for those married men
<br/><span></span>Maybe I’m miserable
<br/><span></span>I’d rather run for mayor in Splitsville
<br/><span></span>Than suffer your jokes again<br/><span></span><br/><span></span><br></div><hr><table><tbody><tr><td>Song name&nbsp;</td><td>For Mayor in Splitsville</td><tr><td>Artist&nbsp;</td><td>La Dispute</td><tr><td>Album&nbsp;</td><td>Rooms of the House</td></tbody></table><div id="lyrics-actions"><a href="https://github.com/Lyrics/lyrics-database/edit/master/database/L/La Dispute/Rooms of the House/For Mayor in Splitsville">Suggest improvements for this text</a><br></div></div></div></div><script>const i=document.createElement("input");i.name="q";i.type="search";i.placeholder="Search";document.forms[0].firstChild.appendChild(i)</script>
