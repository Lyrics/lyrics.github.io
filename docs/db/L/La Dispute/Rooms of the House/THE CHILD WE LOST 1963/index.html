<br/><span></span>Where the light got thrown by the lamp on the night stand
<br/><span></span>On your mother's side, after midnight, still
<br/><span></span>You can see it all, you can see it all<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>And the closet in the corner
<br/><span></span>On the far back shelf with the keepsakes, she hid
<br/><span></span>That box there, full of letters of regret
<br/><span></span>By the pictures of the kids<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>You get faint recollections of your
<br/><span></span>Mother's sigh, countryside drive
<br/><span></span>And the landscape seen from the window of the back seat
<br/><span></span>With some flowers in a basket<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>That afternoon after school
<br/><span></span>You and your older sisters
<br/><span></span>Found your parents in the kitchen at the table
<br/><span></span>Father lifting off the lid of the box<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>And a hush fell
<br/><span></span>Over everything like a funeral prayer
<br/><span></span>A reverence, ancestral, heavy in the air
<br/><span></span>Though you didn't understand what it meant<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>That they never said her name aloud around you
<br/><span></span>Even sitting at the table with her things they'd kept
<br/><span></span>You recall faintly cards, tiny clothes
<br/><span></span>And the smell of the paint in the upstairs bedroom
<br/><span></span>Until then you didn't know that's what the box had held<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>Your parents tiptoeing slowly around
<br/><span></span>Always speaking in code<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>No, they never said her name aloud around you
<br/><span></span>Only told you it was perfect where your sister went
<br/><span></span>And you didn't understand why it hurt them
<br/><span></span>So much then that she'd come and left so soon
<br/><span></span>Could only guess inside your head at what a "stillbirth" meant
<br/><span></span>Only knew that mother wept<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>You watched while father held her
<br/><span></span>Said "Some things come, but can't stay here"
<br/><span></span>You saw a brightness, like a light through your eyes
<br/><span></span>Closed tight then she tumbled away<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>From here, some place
<br/><span></span>To remain in the night time shadows she made
<br/><span></span>To be an absence in mom
<br/><span></span>A sadness hanging over her<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>Like some pentecostal flame
<br/><span></span>Drifting on and off
<br/><span></span>She was "Sister" only whispered
<br/><span></span>Sometimes "Her" or "The Child We Lost"<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>You were visions
<br/><span></span>A vagueness
<br/><span></span>A faded image
<br/><span></span>You were visions<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>You were a flame lit
<br/><span></span>That burned out twice as brightly
<br/><span></span>As the rest of us did
<br/><span></span>When you left, you were light
<br/><span></span>Then you tumbled away<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>There are shadows that fall
<br/><span></span>Still here at a certain angle
<br/><span></span>In the bedroom on the night stand
<br/><span></span>By your mother's side
<br/><span></span>From the light left on there<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>There's the box in the closet
<br/><span></span>All the things kept
<br/><span></span>And the landscape where she left
<br/><span></span>Flowers on the grave
<br/><span></span>Marble where they etched that name
<br/><span></span>And mother cried the whole way home<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>But she never said it once out loud
<br/><span></span>On the way back home from where you thought they meant
<br/><span></span>When they said where sister went<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>After grandpa got hospice sick
<br/><span></span>And he couldn't fall sleep
<br/><span></span>They wheeled his stretcher bed beside her at night
<br/><span></span>And I saw the light<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>On the day that he died
<br/><span></span>By their bed in grandma's eyes
<br/><span></span>While us grandkids said our goodbyes<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>She said, "Don't cry"
<br/><span></span>Somewhere he holds her
<br/><span></span>And said a name I didn't recognize
<br/><span></span>And the light with all the shadows combined…;<br/><span></span><br/><span></span><br></div><hr><table><tbody><tr><td>Song name&nbsp;</td><td>THE CHILD WE LOST 1963</td><tr><td>Artist&nbsp;</td><td>La Dispute</td><tr><td>Album&nbsp;</td><td>Rooms of the House</td></tbody></table><div id="lyrics-actions"><a href="https://github.com/Lyrics/lyrics/edit/master/database/L/La Dispute/Rooms of the House/THE CHILD WE LOST 1963">Suggest improvements for this text</a></div></div></div></div><script>var i=document.createElement("input");i.name="q";i.type="search";i.placeholder="Search";document.forms[0].firstChild.appendChild(i)</script>
