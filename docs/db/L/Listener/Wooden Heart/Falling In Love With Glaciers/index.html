<br/><span></span>Claimed she grew up from a grain of sand
<br/><span></span>With every year wider she bloomed a little bit longer
<br/><span></span>To the roof of the sky with outstretched hands
<br/><span></span>She made friends with the sun, shared enemies with no one
<br/><span></span>Counted weeks like she should of counted days
<br/><span></span>And swallowed handfuls of night so she could sleep tight
<br/><span></span>And turn her thoughts from its stone cold ways<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>And this was the beginning, the start of the ending
<br/><span></span>You can’t die from a broken heart
<br/><span></span>But from the time the sun rose
<br/><span></span>To the space where it fell away
<br/><span></span>She would love, and it wouldn’t take part
<br/><span></span>And every every day she would echo echo
<br/><span></span>In every single way she should let go let go
<br/><span></span>But it had her in its sights cupids icy arrows
<br/><span></span>But so, so what<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>So she caught every one with her heart like it was her duty
<br/><span></span>It walked the wrong wrong way down her one way plan
<br/><span></span>She was surrounded by forests, rivers and beauty
<br/><span></span>Until that glacier froze over the land
<br/><span></span>And so she blamed herself hated her wealth
<br/><span></span>She was born at too young of an age
<br/><span></span>And every night her dreams were touched by witches fingers
<br/><span></span>Until her heart was caged.
<br/><span></span>With every morning spent not caring if she cares or not
<br/><span></span>Sleeping in the melt and mud, waiting for the earth to rot
<br/><span></span>Burying herself alive she scrapes the hole that it left open
<br/><span></span>Empty as her very heart, that mountain was all broken
<br/><span></span>All broken, that mountain was all broken<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>Now I can see that her
<br/><span></span>Her blood’s red and she’s got feelings
<br/><span></span>And they always get spilled both without thinking
<br/><span></span>Without thinking, without thinking,
<br/><span></span>Without thinking, I can see that her<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>Her blood’s red and she’s got feelings
<br/><span></span>And they always get spilled both without thinking
<br/><span></span>Without thinking, they weren’t thinking,
<br/><span></span>Without thinking, I can see that her<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>Her blood’s red and she’s got feelings
<br/><span></span>And they always get spilled both without thinking
<br/><span></span>Without thinking, I wasn’t thinking,
<br/><span></span>Without thinking, I can see that our<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>Our blood’s red and we got feelings
<br/><span></span>And we always spill both bloods without thinking
<br/><span></span>Without thinking, what were we thinking,
<br/><span></span>We weren’t thinking, what were we thinking of<br/><span></span><br/><span></span><br></div><hr><table><tbody><tr><td>Song name&nbsp;</td><td>Falling In Love With Glaciers</td><tr><td>Artist&nbsp;</td><td>Listener</td><tr><td>Album&nbsp;</td><td>Wooden Heart</td><tr><td>Track number&nbsp;</td><td>5</td><tr><td>Year&nbsp;</td><td>2010</td><tr><td>Language&nbsp;</td><td>American English</td></tbody></table><div id="lyrics-actions"><a href="https://github.com/Lyrics/lyrics-database/edit/master/database/L/Listener/Wooden Heart/Falling In Love With Glaciers">Suggest improvements for this text</a><br></div></div></div></div><script>const i=document.createElement("input");i.name="q";i.type="search";i.placeholder="Search";document.forms[0].firstChild.appendChild(i)</script>
