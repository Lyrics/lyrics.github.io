<br/><span></span>And as I stand on this cliff, the wind whips through me and I am made bold
<br/><span></span>Once again, Your presence creeps into my consciousness
<br/><span></span>Grace made tangible in this newly anointed place
<br/><span></span>And I am brought to my clear senses
<br/><span></span>That none of my perceived failings or disgrace
<br/><span></span>Has ever touched my being or inheritance
<br/><span></span>I am whole, I am clean, I am free
<br/><span></span>And I brought to my knees
<br/><span></span>Sink in; permeate this weary flesh
<br/><span></span>Breathe; life as clean and fresh
<br/><span></span>As the salt-seasoned breeze
<br/><span></span>Please Father, pull me to my feet<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>'Why are you kneeling, my son?
<br/><span></span>I put strength in that back-bone
<br/><span></span>Knowing that you would fall
<br/><span></span>But I promise, you will never taste defeat
<br/><span></span>You are whole, you are clean, you are free
<br/><span></span>Get up, rise from your knees!'<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>We can no longer linger in the shadows of our shame and brokenness
<br/><span></span>For as sure as the wind blows
<br/><span></span>He has already redeemed all of this
<br/><span></span>Live as whole, live as clean, live as free
<br/><span></span>Everything you were made to be
<br/><span></span>Standing at the edge of self-discovery
<br/><span></span>Tired and weary
<br/><span></span>Our body trembles, buckles
<br/><span></span>We are afraid of being hurt again
<br/><span></span>Been stabbed in the back by our own friends
<br/><span></span>We don't know if we can mend
<br/><span></span>Minds riddled with unsuccessful recoveries
<br/><span></span>We're scared
<br/><span></span>Lord, we're terrified
<br/><span></span>But dive in we must
<br/><span></span>Cause there has to be something better than this
<br/><span></span>For we see testimony of You in the sea
<br/><span></span>Your creation, all of nature
<br/><span></span>So with a sudden rush
<br/><span></span>We abandon our solitary perching place
<br/><span></span>And as we wash away the mourning dust
<br/><span></span>Immersed; we see Your face<br/><span></span><br/><span></span><br></div><hr><table><tbody><tr><td>Song name&nbsp;</td><td>The Sea Always Seems to Put Me At Ease</td><tr><td>Artist&nbsp;</td><td>Being As An Ocean</td><tr><td>Album&nbsp;</td><td>Dear G-D...</td></tbody></table><div id="lyrics-actions"><a href="https://github.com/Lyrics/lyrics-database/edit/master/database/B/Being As An Ocean/Dear G-D/The Sea Always Seems to Put Me At Ease">Suggest improvements for this text</a><br></div></div></div></div><script>const i=document.createElement("input");i.name="q";i.type="search";i.placeholder="Search";document.forms[0].firstChild.appendChild(i)</script></html>
