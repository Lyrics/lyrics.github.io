<br/><span></span>Recounted endless times by the aging and old
<br/><span></span>Tales of peace, worship and holy places
<br/><span></span>Palaces adorned with gold and lofty terraces
<br/><span></span>But I'm always left with quiet dismay
<br/><span></span>Cause I'm told that some of those I love won't be with me
<br/><span></span>So I'm left behind in an eternal place
<br/><span></span>Cause the ones who meant the most didn't receive Your grace
<br/><span></span>They called it beautiful, but to me it holds nothing that is holy
<br/><span></span>I can only know what I've seen
<br/><span></span>And what I've seen is that You've made us clean
<br/><span></span>Given us the right to be anything we want to be
<br/><span></span>Why would You give me eyes to see and then deny me these?
<br/><span></span>Eternity is a lock found inside our hearts and You've handed Humanity the key
<br/><span></span>So I won't be swayed by fantasies of unquenchable flames
<br/><span></span>Or some place of torment, the damned never to see Your face
<br/><span></span>We are all Your creation
<br/><span></span>You love us all the same
<br/><span></span>A Father doesn't sit idly by while His children are maimed
<br/><span></span>I've seen true Grace
<br/><span></span>I promise you we will never feel the lick of those flames
<br/><span></span>Where Death is your glory?
<br/><span></span>Where Death is your sting?
<br/><span></span>For we are all children of the King
<br/><span></span>Every last one an eternal being
<br/><span></span>So I'll reject your fear and hatred
<br/><span></span>For I bring Good News that will be for all nations!
<br/><span></span>I've seen wholeness in the broken
<br/><span></span>I've seen health in the sick
<br/><span></span>Why do we stifle the Word You've spoken?
<br/><span></span>If it kills me, I'll tear these walls down brick by brick
<br/><span></span>I've seen hospitality in the homeless
<br/><span></span>I've seen Light in the darkness
<br/><span></span>And I've seen hope in the damned
<br/><span></span>So if all that has meant the most to me isn't present after my last breath
<br/><span></span>Count me with the fallen sheep and send me to the depths<br/><span></span><br/><span></span><br></div><hr><table><tbody><tr><td>Song name&nbsp;</td><td>If They're Not Counted, Count Me Out</td><tr><td>Artist&nbsp;</td><td>Being As An Ocean</td><tr><td>Album&nbsp;</td><td>Dear G-D...</td></tbody></table><div id="lyrics-actions"><a href="https://github.com/Lyrics/lyrics-database/edit/master/database/B/Being As An Ocean/Dear G-D/If They&#x27;re Not Counted, Count Me Out">Suggest improvements for this text</a><br></div></div></div></div><script>var i=document.createElement("input");i.name="q";i.type="search";i.placeholder="Search";document.forms[0].firstChild.appendChild(i)</script>
