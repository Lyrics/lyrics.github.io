<br/><span></span>But I’m only going to get this one chance
<br/><span></span>Something’s wrong, I can feel it (Six minutes, Slim Shady, you’re on)
<br/><span></span>Just a feeling I’ve got, like something’s about to happen, but I don’t know what
<br/><span></span>If that means what I think it means, we’re in trouble – big trouble
<br/><span></span>And if he is bananas as you say, I’m not taking any chances
<br/><span></span>You are just what the doctor ordered<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>I’m beginning to feel like a Rap God, Rap God
<br/><span></span>All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod
<br/><span></span>Now who thinks their arms are long enough to slapbox, slapbox?
<br/><span></span>They said I rap like a robot, so call me Rapbot<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>But for me to rap like a computer must be in my genes
<br/><span></span>I got a laptop in my back pocket
<br/><span></span>My pen’ll go off when I half-cock it
<br/><span></span>Got a fat knot from that rap profit<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>Made a living and a killing off it
<br/><span></span>Ever since Bill Clinton was still in office
<br/><span></span>With Monica Lewinsky feeling on his nut-sack
<br/><span></span>I’m an MC still as honest<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>But as rude and indecent as all hell
<br/><span></span>Syllables skill-a-holic (Kill ’em all with)
<br/><span></span>This slickety-gippety-hippity-hip-hop
<br/><span></span>You don’t really wanna get into a pissing match with this rappity-rap
<br/><span></span>Packing a Mack in the back of the Ac, backpack rap, yap-yap, yacketty-yack<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>And now at the exact same time
<br/><span></span>I attempt these lyrical acrobat stunts while I’m practicing that
<br/><span></span>I’ll still be able to break a motherfuckin’ table
<br/><span></span>Over the back of a couple of faggots and crack it in half<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>Only realized it was ironic I was signed to Aftermath after the fact
<br/><span></span>How could I not blow? All I do is drop F-bombs, feel my wrath of attack
<br/><span></span>Rappers are having a rough time period, here’s a maxi-pad
<br/><span></span>It’s actually disastrously bad for the wack
<br/><span></span>While I’m masterfully constructing this masterpiece, yeah<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>’Cause I’m beginning to feel like a Rap God, Rap God
<br/><span></span>All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod
<br/><span></span>Now who thinks their arms are long enough to slapbox, slapbox?
<br/><span></span>Let me show you maintaining this shit ain’t that hard, that hard<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>Everybody want the key and the secret to rap immortality like I have got
<br/><span></span>Well, to be truthful the blueprint’s simply rage and youthful exuberance
<br/><span></span>Everybody loves to root for a nuisance
<br/><span></span>Hit the earth like an asteroid, I did nothing but shoot for the moon since
<br/><span></span>*pew*<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>MCs get taken to school with this music
<br/><span></span>’Cause I use it as a vehicle to bust the rhyme
<br/><span></span>Now I lead a new school full of students
<br/><span></span>Me? I’m a product of Rakim, Lakim Shabazz, 2Pac, N-
<br/><span></span>-W.A, Cube, hey Doc, Ren, Yella, Eazy, thank you, they got Slim<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>Inspired enough to one day grow up, blow up, and be in a position
<br/><span></span>To meet Run-D.M.C. and induct them into the motherfuckin’ Rock n’
<br/><span></span>Roll Hall of Fame
<br/><span></span>Even though I’ll walk in the church and burst in a ball of flames
<br/><span></span>Only Hall of Fame I be inducted in is the alcohol of fame
<br/><span></span>On the wall of shame
<br/><span></span>You fags think it’s all a game till I walk a flock of flames
<br/><span></span>Off a plank and, tell me what in the fuck are you thinking?
<br/><span></span>Little gay looking boy<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>So gay I can barely say it with a straight face looking boy
<br/><span></span>You witnessing a massacre
<br/><span></span>Like you watching a church gathering take place looking boy
<br/><span></span>Oy vey, that boy’s gay, that’s all they say looking boy
<br/><span></span>You get a thumbs up, pat on the back
<br/><span></span>And a way to go from your label everyday looking boy
<br/><span></span>Hey, looking boy, what you say looking boy?
<br/><span></span>I get a "hell yeah" from Dre looking boy
<br/><span></span>I’mma work for everything I have
<br/><span></span>Never asked nobody for that shit, get outta my face looking boy
<br/><span></span>Basically boy you’re never gonna be capable
<br/><span></span>Of keeping up with the same pace looking boy<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>’Cause I’m beginning to feel like a Rap God, Rap God
<br/><span></span>All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod
<br/><span></span>The way I’m racing around the track, call me Nascar, Nascar
<br/><span></span>Dale Earnhardt of the trailer park, the White Trash God
<br/><span></span>Kneel before General Zod this planet’s Krypton, no Asgard, Asgard<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>So you be Thor and I’ll be Odin, you rodent, I’m omnipotent
<br/><span></span>Let off then I’m reloading immediately with these bombs I’m totin’
<br/><span></span>And I should not be woken
<br/><span></span>I’m the walking dead, but I’m just a talking head, a zombie floating
<br/><span></span>But I got your mom deep throating<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>I’m out my Ramen noodle, we have nothing in common, poodle
<br/><span></span>I’m a Doberman, pinch yourself in the arm and pay homage, pupil
<br/><span></span>It’s me, my honesty’s brutal
<br/><span></span>But it’s honestly futile if I don’t utilize what I do though<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>For good at least once in a while
<br/><span></span>So I wanna make sure somewhere in this chicken scratch I scribble and doodle
<br/><span></span>Enough rhymes to maybe try to help get some people through tough times
<br/><span></span>But I gotta keep a few punchlines just in case ’cause even you unsigned
<br/><span></span>Rappers are hungry looking at me like it’s lunchtime
<br/><span></span>I know there was a time where once I
<br/><span></span>Was king of the underground, but I still rap like I’m on my Pharoahe Monch grind<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>So I crunch rhymes, but sometimes when you combine
<br/><span></span>Appeal with the skin color of mine
<br/><span></span>You get too big and here they come trying to censor you
<br/><span></span>Like that one line I said on "I’m Back" from The Mathers LP
<br/><span></span>One where I tried to say I’d take seven kids from Columbine
<br/><span></span>Put ’em all in a line, add an AK-47, a revolver and a nine
<br/><span></span>See if I get away with it now that I ain’t as big as I was, but I’m<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>Morphin’ into an immortal coming through the portal
<br/><span></span>You’re stuck in a time warp from 2004 though
<br/><span></span>And I don’t know what the fuck that you rhyme for
<br/><span></span>You’re pointless as Rapunzel with fucking cornrows
<br/><span></span>You write normal, fuck being normal
<br/><span></span>And I just bought a new raygun from the future<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>To just come and shoot ya like when Fabolous made Ray J mad
<br/><span></span>’Cause Fab said he looked like a fag at Maywhether’s pad
<br/><span></span>Singin’ to a man while he played piano
<br/><span></span>Man, oh, man, that was the 24/7 special on the cable channel
<br/><span></span>So Ray J went straight to the radio station the very next day
<br/><span></span>"Hey, Fab, I’mma kill you"
<br/><span></span>Lyrics coming at you at supersonic speed, JJ Fad<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>Uh, sama lamaa duma lamaa you assuming I’m a human
<br/><span></span>What I gotta do to get it through to you I’m superhuman
<br/><span></span>Innovative and I’m made of rubber
<br/><span></span>So that anything you say is ricocheting off of me and it’ll glue to you
<br/><span></span>I’m devastating, more than never demonstrating
<br/><span></span>How to give a motherfuckin’ audience a feeling like it’s levitating
<br/><span></span>Never fading, and I know the haters are forever waiting
<br/><span></span>For the day that they can say I fell off, they’ll be celebrating
<br/><span></span>’Cause I know the way to get ’em motivated
<br/><span></span>I make elevating music, you make elevator music
<br/><span></span>Oh, he’s too mainstream
<br/><span></span>Well, that’s what they do when they get jealous, they confuse it
<br/><span></span>It’s not hip-hop, it’s pop, ’cause I found a hella way to fuse it
<br/><span></span>With rock, shock rap with Doc
<br/><span></span>Throw on Lose Yourself and make ’em lose it<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>I don’t know how to make songs like that
<br/><span></span>I don’t know what words to use
<br/><span></span>Let me know when it occurs to you
<br/><span></span>While I’m ripping any one of these verses diverse as you
<br/><span></span>It’s curtains, I’m inadvertently hurtin’ you
<br/><span></span>How many verses I gotta murder to prove
<br/><span></span>That if you were half as nice, your songs and you could sacrifice virgins too<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>School flunky, pill junky
<br/><span></span>But look at the accolades these skills brung me
<br/><span></span>Full of myself, but still hungry
<br/><span></span>I bully myself ’cause I make me do what I put my mind to
<br/><span></span>And I’m a million leagues above you, ill when I speak in tongues
<br/><span></span>But it’s still tongue and cheek, fuck you
<br/><span></span>I’m drunk so Satan take the fucking wheel, I’m asleep in the front seat
<br/><span></span>Bumping Heavy D. & the Boys, still chunky, but funky
<br/><span></span>But in my head there’s something I can feel tugging and struggling
<br/><span></span>Angels fight with devils and here’s what they want from me<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>They asking me to eliminate some of the women hate
<br/><span></span>But if you take into consideration the bitter hatred that I had
<br/><span></span>Then you may be a little patient and more sympathetic to the situation
<br/><span></span>And understand the discrimination<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>But fuck it, life’s handing you lemons, make lemonade then
<br/><span></span>But if I can’t batter the women how the fuck am I supposed to bake them a cake then?
<br/><span></span>Don’t mistake it for Satan
<br/><span></span>It’s a fatal mistake if you think I need to be overseas
<br/><span></span>And take a vacation to trip a broad
<br/><span></span>And make her fall on her face and don’t be a retard
<br/><span></span>Be a king? Think not
<br/><span></span>Why be a king when you can be a God?<br/><span></span><br/><span></span><br/></div><hr/><table><tbody><tr><td>Song name&nbsp;</td><td>Rap God</td><tr><td>Artist&nbsp;</td><td>Eminem</td><tr><td>Album&nbsp;</td><td>The Marshall Mathers LP 2</td></tbody></table><div id="lyrics-actions"><a href="https://github.com/Lyrics/lyrics/edit/master/database/E/Eminem/The Marshall Mathers LP 2/Rap God">Suggest improvements for this text</a></div></div></div></div><script>var i=document.createElement("input");i.name="q";i.type="search";i.placeholder="Search";document.forms[0].firstChild.appendChild(i)</script>
