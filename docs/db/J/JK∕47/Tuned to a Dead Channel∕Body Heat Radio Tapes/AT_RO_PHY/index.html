<br/><span></span>Day comes to a close.
<br/><span></span>Families slowly disappear and nightlife blooms.
<br/><span></span>Strolling down 4th avenue pulling exhaust from the Turkish bone,
<br/><span></span>watching the parade of cut off short-shorts and flannel shirts — up and down the street.
<br/><span></span>It’s an old town with old time architecture and present day street cars.
<br/><span></span>The smell of dry beer is lingering.
<br/><span></span>Ignoring the casual glances and curiosities,
<br/><span></span>I’ve become more oddity then resident;
<br/><span></span>somewhere within the crowd but never there.<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>This town’s downtown is nostalgic neon, on these amphetamines.
<br/><span></span>The nicotine instigates patience/ the symptoms placate the emotions/ and what seemed years ago/
<br/><span></span>has you forlorn/ a voyeur/ an unwanted visitor/
<br/><span></span>The “No Loiter” sign is lit/
<br/><span></span>the street divots from mortars/
<br/><span></span>I’m walking among the derelict vehicles in the jungle/
<br/><span></span>Drifting into that place where spirits meet and old traditions mingle/
<br/><span></span>A stray animal/ the grip on the rubber band handle/ Perhaps I’m pissed./
<br/><span></span>There’s kind of a lot more to it/
<br/><span></span>Money is scarce and there’s fuck-all to do with all this Covid/
<br/><span></span>The Conspiracies are happening (or not). Who gives a shit?/
<br/><span></span>Everyone is arguing over bathrooms, decorum, politics/ parking spaces at entropy, you name it/
<br/><span></span>I’m pissed off/tee’d off/ off my rocker – Coocoo for Cocoa but too cool/ for school when it comes to mental junk food / and brain candy decay. Binge watching the flip-flops./ I’m a few bucks away from a one stop shop wanting two cans of the kind and that’s Sam I am; double fisting micheladas on a funday. A suedehead, demented, skinhead in Timberlands with a scowl under my skully/ two eyes over ugly/ skipping over the other drunks and their booze blues/ while pissing on the dessicated scenarios of “who’s who?”/ When I guess really it should be “Who’s food?”/
<br/><span></span>Unhinged and undone/ A typewriter on my tongue and more knives in pocket than all of London/
<br/><span></span>On the lookout for Late night artifacts and reflections/
<br/><span></span>The things I've done and seen/
<br/><span></span>Things you wouldn't believe/
<br/><span></span>Flashes of metal in the dark/ wet letters and pain killers in the park/ Some of us hunt and others fatten up the mark/ passed out with money peeking out their skinny jeans? Don’t let me start/
<br/><span></span>I seen second-hand felons with first class fabrications/
<br/><span></span>loose lips sunken ships/ brittle like potato chips/
<br/><span></span>Buck50’d across the face; watching the white meat peek where the blade drips/
<br/><span></span>Delerium Tremens of a nostalgic/ living in my moment/ some say it’s tragic/ Black magick and white lines, tracing memories across the looking glass with a fractured reflection/ The pensive mind, restless/ The basics/ destroy or build/ the mathematic of my inception/
<br/><span></span>Born into this/
<br/><span></span>Honed by this/<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>However this place I haunt drags its feet/ the creosote smells sweet/
<br/><span></span>yet the food is too bland to eat/
<br/><span></span>The weather never changes/
<br/><span></span>and the culture smells like ass/
<br/><span></span>Everyone smokes grass/
<br/><span></span>and the flags fly full mast/
<br/><span></span>The Old-Pueblo; home of the paleface 85 percenter/
<br/><span></span>Someplace between nothing, nada and nowhere/
<br/><span></span>subdued and beggared/
<br/><span></span>People speak tongue-n-cheek and cough into their masks/
<br/><span></span>the night life tastes like flat ass (Pabst Blue Ribbon) and the culture is a mishmash/ of “Blehh”/
<br/><span></span>To call it “Paradise” would be a misnomer/
<br/><span></span>Reality is a slick gossamer,/ too thin to grasp (a shot in the dark).
<br/><span></span>And too think that I thought to think that the grass would be greener on the other side/
<br/><span></span>I thought, to think. And by a rumor I was bribed/
<br/><span></span>I was sullen, / bereft of the American dream and disillusioned/.
<br/><span></span>Creatively agitated and detached from the collective consciousness/
<br/><span></span>The obnoxious/ nonsense/ of the nothingness/ of modern life and its digital echoes.
<br/><span></span>Born into this/
<br/><span></span>Molded by this/
<br/><span></span>Mentally vexed/ detached/ an analog insomniac/
<br/><span></span>Writing from the fringes in words and sigils and images, it’s somewhat mnemonic/
<br/><span></span>(Short fuse) Scratching for a decent ending on a counterfeit lottery ticket/
<br/><span></span>Walking in the neon shadows of a memory - when wolves lived free in the guise of men and women; instead of sleepwalking here with the dreamers, where everyone is a plate and the food is spoiled.<br/><span></span><br/><span></span><br></div><hr><table><tbody><tr><td>Song name&nbsp;</td><td>AT_RO_PHY</td><tr><td>Artist&nbsp;</td><td>JK/47,  SamHaiNe</td><tr><td>Album&nbsp;</td><td>Tuned to a Dead Channel/Body Heat Radio Tapes</td><tr><td>Track number&nbsp;</td><td>15</td><tr><td>Year&nbsp;</td><td>2022</td><tr><td>Original text by&nbsp;</td><td>Sam Haine</td></tbody></table><div id="lyrics-actions"><a href="https://github.com/Lyrics/lyrics-database/edit/master/database/J/JK∕47/Tuned to a Dead Channel∕Body Heat Radio Tapes/AT_RO_PHY">Suggest improvements for this text</a><br></div></div></div></div><script>var i=document.createElement("input");i.name="q";i.type="search";i.placeholder="Search";document.forms[0].firstChild.appendChild(i)</script>
