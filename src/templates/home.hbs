    <h3>About the open lyrics database</h3>
    <p>Many artists don't have their lyrics available online in the correct form.<br/>
    This project has started in an attempt to resolve this issue through obtaining and publishing lyrics by reaching out to the original authors.</p>
    <h3>Legal</h3>
    <p>We attribute proper credits to every file in the database once the authorship and ownership are ensured.</p>
    <h3>Contributing</h3>
    <p>For corrections, contributions, or any other inquiries, please use <a href="mailto:open.lyrics.database@gmail.com">open.lyrics.database@gmail.com</a></p>
    <p>It's also possible to work with the data directly via <a href="https://github.com/Lyrics/lyrics">this GitHub repository</a>.</p>
