<br/><span></span>I wanted to tell her till I looked in her eyes
<br/><span></span>I wanted to tell her!
<br/><span></span>I needed to tell her!<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>Just like the wind you blew away your happy lover's touch
<br/><span></span>You bring the blues into my life just like a rush
<br/><span></span>I cannot bear the way my heart has helped to keep you close
<br/><span></span>Of you my babe I cannot get enough, you touched me baby!<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>I loved you to the lines of lies you told when I asked her name
<br/><span></span>I knew the perfume in your hair just wasn't mine
<br/><span></span>Did you ever think to notice me when you wasn't home?
<br/><span></span>I noticed every time<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>I wanted to tell her but I stuck to my lies
<br/><span></span>I wanted to tell her till I looked in her eyes
<br/><span></span>I wanted to tell her but I stuck to my lies
<br/><span></span>I wanted to tell her till I looked in her eyes<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>Thought you noticed every time but you didn't notice a thing
<br/><span></span>I'd have to cover up my calls when the telephone would ring
<br/><span></span>I'm tired of you and the things you do and all the things you say
<br/><span></span>No more babysitting for neurotic girls today<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>I'm thinking that the pain I'm going through just to keep you babe
<br/><span></span>Is something that I should bear
<br/><span></span>Did you ever stop to notice me when you had nothing
<br/><span></span>And I never cared?<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>Just like the wind you blew away your happy lover's touch
<br/><span></span>You bring the blues into my life just like a rush
