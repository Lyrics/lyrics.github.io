It looks an awful lot like fear.<br/>Now, you're so quick to fall on failure, and so quick to raise your voice, like,<br/>'If I can't find a mistake to blame, we didn't have a choice.'</p><p>Oh, but you had an option.<br/>I was your chance to feel complete,<br/>But when I leaned in close to you, you<br/>Kissed your fear instead of me.</p><p>You had my hand in your hand,<br/>You had my lip in your teeth,<br/>You had my heart on your sleeve,<br/>You had a chance to breathe.</p><p>But, boy, you wouldn't let your fear recede so I moved on.</p><p>And it's too late to change your mind now,<br/>You got scared, boy, and I got gone.<br/>Now you failed, and there's no way to turn back time.<br/>You had your chance, boy, I tried."</p><p>"You tried?" I looked her in the eye and smiled,<br/>"My girl, you must understand that fear is not some product that I made.<br/>It crept unwelcome in my head the day they had her torn away.<br/>It changed me.</p><p>Now at the end of every day I lie awake at night and wait<br/>To feel the wires of my brain get cut and quietly rearranged, and<br/>Hear my beaten heart exclaim, 'Still, I refuse to let her go.'</p><p>So we escape to our mistakes for they wait patiently for us.<br/>Oh, how they always wait for me.</p><p>If my fear has kept me here, only my fear can set me free.<br/>And I'm sorry, dear, but don't you dare speak another word.<br/>How could I risk holding your heart in me while still in love with her?<br/>You were wrong."</p></article></div>
