I felt your sickness
Brush against my arm
As I walked by you
Heard your voice but
Couldn't tell that it was you

And slowly
Watched your sickness slip away
Into a place
That I'd once feared, but I
Was not afraid this time

So I gave chase and found it, finally
Slowly feeding from your head
And from my friends, and from my family
So I grabbed it by the neck

"For every lover you have ruined...;"
I dug my nails into its flesh
"...;and every life that you have taken"
Slammed its head against the brick

Its blood poured out onto the pavement
I stirred it in with dirt and spit
"I will take a part of you"
I made mortar from the mix

Tore every organ from its body
Broke its bone and fashioned bricks
I laid the mortar in between
I made a throne for hope to sit

"Too long you've torn us into pieces
Firmly held onto our wrists
Today I bury you in me"
I swallowed every inch of it


I'll
I'll hold you
As you have held me
You've held me in your heart

We'll be
We'll be set free from
We'll be set free from
Fear, we'll be set free

Oh we've felt our failures
We've watched our passions
Leave, but we're still breathing
Oh but we're still beating on

I'll
I'll hold you
As you have held me
You've held me in your heart

(And I will hold you in my heart)


But I still see him
Dead in the parking lot
At the gas station just down the street

And I still hear my friend say
"You know, you wouldn't believe the things
I saw when I was stationed overseas"

But he somehow keeps smiling
In spite all of that
While I keep finding ways
To push the good out for the bad

Oh how selfish of myself
To always say that it was
More than I could take
Like it was pain I couldn't shake
Like it could break me with its fingers
Throw my body in the lake
And I would slowly sink away

But the truth is, it was sorrow
That I made
And wouldn't face
See, I keep falling for the future
After tripping on the past
And I am always tearing sutures out
To make the anguish last

Like it defines me
Or reminds me
I've found comfort in my suffering
And uncertainty in happiness and death
Because what's next is such a mystery to me
And I am terrified of all the things
I feel but cannot see

Friends and family
Put your hand into my hand
And lay your head into my chest
You are all that I have left here
We are all that we have left

We are the lovers
We are the last of our kind
So link your arms and keep your chin up
And I swear that we'll be fine

We are the lovers
We are the last of our kind


Though we are not sure who we are
We keep our heads up
Though we are not sure where we're from
We keep our hearts up
Though we are not sure when we'll leave
We keep our heads up
Though we are not sure where we'll go
We keep our hopes up

Though we're not sure who we are
We keep our heads up
Though we're not sure where we're from
We keep our hearts up
Though we're not sure when we'll leave
We keep our heads up
Though we're not sure where we'll go
We keep our hopes up


Keep your head up
We're fine
Just keep your head up
I swear we'll be alright

Keep your head up
My friends, my friends
Keep your head up
I swear

I swear we'll never die, I swear
We'll get home safe and sound, I swear
I swear we'll never die, I swear
We'll live on underground, I swear


I will give your heart a place to rest
When everything you had has turned and left


I'll weave your names into my ribcage
Lock your hearts inside my chest
Regain the passion I once carried
Do away with all the rest

I tore the sickness from your bodies
Smashed its head against the bricks
I made a castle from its bones
That you may always dwell in it

So sing for every buried moment
That you'd thought would never end
And sing your fears about the future
And a dirge for faded friends

For all the love that you had held to
Why it somehow failed to keep
And sing each minute you've been frightened
Every hour that you've lost sleep

And sing for all your friends and family
Sing for those who didn't survive
But sing not for their final outcome
Sing a song of how they tried

We live amidst a violent storm
Leaves us unsatisfied at best
So fill your hearts with what's important
And be done with all the rest

We are what's left of what we once were
We are falling far behind
There's so much stacking up against us
And we're running out of time

We are but hopeful children
And we're the last of our kind
But if we let our hearts move outward
I know we will never


We are but friends and family
We are the last of our kind
So hold my hand, I'll lift your head up
And I promise we'll be fine

We are but hopeful lovers
And we are running out of time
There's so much stacking up against us
And we're falling far behind

We are but hopeful lovers
We are the last of our kind
But if we let our hearts move outward
I know we will never

We are but lovers
We are the last of our kind
And if we let our hearts move outward
I know we will never

We are but lovers
We are the last of our kind
And if we let our hearts move outward
We will never die
