    <div class="view"><article id="lyrics"><p>I felt your sickness<br/>Brush against my arm<br/>As I walked by you<br/>Heard your voice but<br/>Couldn't tell that it was you</p><p>And slowly<br/>Watched your sickness slip away<br/>Into a place<br/>That I'd once feared, but I<br/>Was not afraid this time</p><p>So I gave chase and found it, finally<br/>Slowly feeding from your head<br/>And from my friends, and from my family<br/>So I grabbed it by the neck</p><p>"For every lover you have ruined...;"<br/>I dug my nails into its flesh<br/>"...;and every life that you have taken"<br/>Slammed its head against the brick</p><p>Its blood poured out onto the pavement<br/>I stirred it in with dirt and spit<br/>"I will take a part of you"<br/>I made mortar from the mix</p><p>Tore every organ from its body<br/>Broke its bone and fashioned bricks<br/>I laid the mortar in between<br/>I made a throne for hope to sit</p><p>"Too long you've torn us into pieces<br/>Firmly held onto our wrists<br/>Today I bury you in me"<br/>I swallowed every inch of it</p><p>I'll<br/>I'll hold you<br/>As you have held me<br/>You've held me in your heart</p><p>We'll be<br/>We'll be set free from<br/>We'll be set free from<br/>Fear, we'll be set free</p><p>Oh we've felt our failures<br/>We've watched our passions<br/>Leave, but we're still breathing<br/>Oh but we're still beating on</p><p>I'll<br/>I'll hold you<br/>As you have held me<br/>You've held me in your heart</p><p>(And I will hold you in my heart)</p><p>But I still see him<br/>Dead in the parking lot<br/>At the gas station just down the street</p><p>And I still hear my friend say<br/>"You know, you wouldn't believe the things<br/>I saw when I was stationed overseas"</p><p>But he somehow keeps smiling<br/>In spite all of that<br/>While I keep finding ways<br/>To push the good out for the bad</p><p>Oh how selfish of myself<br/>To always say that it was<br/>More than I could take<br/>Like it was pain I couldn't shake<br/>Like it could break me with its fingers<br/>Throw my body in the lake<br/>And I would slowly sink away</p><p>But the truth is, it was sorrow<br/>That I made<br/>And wouldn't face<br/>See, I keep falling for the future<br/>After tripping on the past<br/>And I am always tearing sutures out<br/>To make the anguish last</p><p>Like it defines me<br/>Or reminds me<br/>I've found comfort in my suffering<br/>And uncertainty in happiness and death<br/>Because what's next is such a mystery to me<br/>And I am terrified of all the things<br/>I feel but cannot see</p><p>Friends and family<br/>Put your hand into my hand<br/>And lay your head into my chest<br/>You are all that I have left here<br/>We are all that we have left</p><p>We are the lovers<br/>We are the last of our kind<br/>So link your arms and keep your chin up<br/>And I swear that we'll be fine</p><p>We are the lovers<br/>We are the last of our kind</p><p>Though we are not sure who we are<br/>We keep our heads up<br/>Though we are not sure where we're from<br/>We keep our hearts up<br/>Though we are not sure when we'll leave<br/>We keep our heads up<br/>Though we are not sure where we'll go<br/>We keep our hopes up</p><p>Though we're not sure who we are<br/>We keep our heads up<br/>Though we're not sure where we're from<br/>We keep our hearts up<br/>Though we're not sure when we'll leave<br/>We keep our heads up<br/>Though we're not sure where we'll go<br/>We keep our hopes up</p><p>Keep your head up<br/>We're fine<br/>Just keep your head up<br/>I swear we'll be alright</p><p>Keep your head up<br/>My friends, my friends<br/>Keep your head up<br/>I swear</p><p>I swear we'll never die, I swear<br/>We'll get home safe and sound, I swear<br/>I swear we'll never die, I swear<br/>We'll live on underground, I swear</p><p>I will give your heart a place to rest<br/>When everything you had has turned and left</p><p>I'll weave your names into my ribcage<br/>Lock your hearts inside my chest<br/>Regain the passion I once carried<br/>Do away with all the rest</p><p>I tore the sickness from your bodies<br/>Smashed its head against the bricks<br/>I made a castle from its bones<br/>That you may always dwell in it</p><p>So sing for every buried moment<br/>That you'd thought would never end<br/>And sing your fears about the future<br/>And a dirge for faded friends</p><p>For all the love that you had held to<br/>Why it somehow failed to keep<br/>And sing each minute you've been frightened<br/>Every hour that you've lost sleep</p><p>And sing for all your friends and family<br/>Sing for those who didn't survive<br/>But sing not for their final outcome<br/>Sing a song of how they tried</p><p>We live amidst a violent storm<br/>Leaves us unsatisfied at best<br/>So fill your hearts with what's important<br/>And be done with all the rest</p><p>We are what's left of what we once were<br/>We are falling far behind<br/>There's so much stacking up against us<br/>And we're running out of time</p><p>We are but hopeful children<br/>And we're the last of our kind<br/>But if we let our hearts move outward<br/>I know we will never</p><p>We are but friends and family<br/>We are the last of our kind<br/>So hold my hand, I'll lift your head up<br/>And I promise we'll be fine</p><p>We are but hopeful lovers<br/>And we are running out of time<br/>There's so much stacking up against us<br/>And we're falling far behind</p><p>We are but hopeful lovers<br/>We are the last of our kind<br/>But if we let our hearts move outward<br/>I know we will never</p><p>We are but lovers<br/>We are the last of our kind<br/>And if we let our hearts move outward<br/>I know we will never</p><p>We are but lovers<br/>We are the last of our kind<br/>And if we let our hearts move outward<br/>We will never die</p></article></div>
