place<span><br/></span>That I'd once feared, but I<span><br/></span>Was not afraid this time<span><br/></span><span class="g"><br/></span>So I gave chase and found it, finally<span><br/></span>Slowly feeding from your head<span><br/></span>And from my friends, and from my family<span><br/></span>So I grabbed it by the neck<span><br/></span><span class="g"><br/></span>"For every lover you have ruined...;"<span><br/></span>I dug my nails into its flesh<span><br/></span>"...;and every life that you have taken"<span><br/></span>Slammed its head against the brick<span><br/></span><span

lot<span><br/></span>At the gas station just down the street<span><br/></span><span class="g"><br/></span>And I still hear my friend say<span><br/></span>"You know, you wouldn't believe the things<span><br/></span>I saw when I was stationed overseas"<span><br/></span><span class="g"><br/></span>But he somehow keeps smiling<span><br/></span>In spite all of that<span><br/></span>While I

face<span><br/></span>See, I keep falling for the future<span><br/></span>After tripping on the past<span><br/></span>And I am always tearing sutures out<span><br/></span>To make the anguish last<span><br/></span><span class="g"><br/></span>Like it defines me<span><br/></span>Or reminds me<span><br/></span>I've found comfort in my suffering<span><br/></span>And uncertainty in happiness and death<span><br/></span>Because what's next is such a mystery to me<span><br/></span>And I am terrified of all the things<span><br/></span>I feel but cannot see<span><br/></span><span class="g"><br/></span>Friends and family<span><br/></span>Put your hand into my hand<span><br/></span>And lay your head into my chest<span><br/></span>You are all that I have left here<span><br/></span>We are all that we have left<span><br/></span><span class="g"><br/></span>We are the lovers<span><br/></span>We are the last of our kind<span><br/></span>So link your arms and

it<span><br/></span><span class="g"><br/></span>So sing for every buried moment<span><br/></span>That you'd thought would never end<span><br/></span>And sing your fears about the future<span><br/></span>And a dirge for faded friends<span><br/></span><span class="g"><br/></span>For all the love that you had held to<span><br/></span>Why it somehow failed to keep<span><br/></span>And sing each minute you've been frightened<span><br/></span>Every hour that you've lost sleep<span><br/></span><span class="g"><br/></span>And sing for all your friends and family<span><br/></span>Sing for those who didn't survive<span><br/></span>But sing not for their final outcome<span><br/></span>Sing a song of how they tried<span><br/></span><span class="g"><br/></span>We live amidst a violent storm<span><br/></span>Leaves us unsatisfied at best<span><br/></span>So fill your hearts with what's important<span><br/></span>And be done with all the rest<span><br/></span><span class="g"><br/></span>We are what's left of what we once were<span><br/></span>We are falling far behind<span><br/></span>There's so much stacking up against us<span><br/></span>And we're running out of time<span><br/></span><span class="g"><br/></span>We are but hopeful children<span><br/></span>And we're the last of our kind<span><br/></span>But if we
