Said,<br/>"Darling, you're the only one on Earth I want to have it"<br/>But now I'm not so sure that that was true<br/>After the hell you put it through</p><p>But there was no sharp pain this time<br/>Just the ghost of your presence compressing my chest like a vine<br/>An unshakeable absence, like most of my insides<br/>Crawled out through my mouth and went west. But that's fine</p><p>We cast our hearts in plaster<br/>We imagined our bodies were fashioned from stone but<br/>They chipped at the brick and the mortar<br/>We found out that we're only layers of skin hiding bone</p><p>And our bones are like chains<br/>Old and rusted in the rain<br/>They're going to snap when the weight shifts</p><p>You moved like a fire through the forest<br/>Your hands were as red as the skin on your lips<br/>You'd been flirting with distance, princess<br/>I tasted its spit in your kiss</p><p>Oh, mistress, know<br/>Today I will bury the flames of your failure<br/>The past is a liar; the future, a whore<br/>I'll lay your bones into the earth and you<br/>Will haunt my head no more</p><p>Oh, we could blame it on our hands<br/>Oh, we could blame it on our hands, but<br/>It was our mouths that opened up to swallow<br/>And our heads that commanded us drink</p><p>But as I buried your flames in the dirt<br/>I watched the smoke pull your ghost from the grave. And<br/>I fear they'll only lay in wait<br/>Till we are face to face again</p><p>Just when I said, "I'm moving, I'm moving on"<br/>I felt them come to life again<br/>And again, and again, and again</p><p>There are fires<br/>That tear through valleys and make dust from grass<br/>There are fires</p><p>There are wires<br/>Bound to blue light they pull us to the past<br/>There are wires</p><p>We are tired<br/>We should've known from the start that this thing wouldn't last<br/>We are tired</p></article></div>
