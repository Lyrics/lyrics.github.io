    <div class="view"><div id="lyrics">Now speak of anger
Forget all the fears you've kept
About love and sex and death and faith
Erased, or swinging sweet
From around her neck

And between her breasts
Let every lonely body
Finally break its fear of flesh
And say, "How strange it must've been
Back when we shook at the sight of sweat"

And let our worries wander out
Like water streaming from a spring
And sing of all the things
Our heads have failed to ruin
There's so much they have failed to ruin yet

Bright as lightning
Loud as thunder
We'll move all the hurt aside
To let love sustain our passions
And move up and onward
We are not our losses
We are only the extent to which we love

So build a home for your family
And build a castle for your friends
Now set their beds with sheets and blankets
Keep them safe until the end

I've felt the damage and burn from the fallout
My love failed but theirs prevailed
My friends, I'm only flesh and bone
But I won't let you die alone

So leave our hearts at the foot of the mountain
Let our burdens be locked in the stone
If you will help me roll it upward
I won't let you die alone

I see a beauty springing upward
From the earth and from out our hearts
For all the bad that seems to plague us
I swear to you there's good

No, oh, I won't let you die alone
My love, I will not let you die alone

They say that death is not a problem
It's a promise
I can only say for sure
That when it makes your bed
I'll kiss your head goodnight

So speak of all the love we lost
And what it cost us
Left us beg our breath to stop
But we kept on
And we were strong
And we, and we

Stayed bright as lightning
We sang loud as thunder
We moved ever forward
We are not our failures
We are love</div></div>
