<title>La Dispute â€“ Fall Down, Never Get Back Up Again | Lyrics</title>
<meta name="description" content="Out where the stones lay like bones by the ocean / Out where the waves crash contempt on the land / Someone was trembling for fear of the tempest / Somebody silently reached for their hand / Said, "Understand that if you're cold, I'll keep you warm / And besides, there's so much beauty in a storm / So come down with me to the shore / And what's more? I adore you / So tell me, what is there to fear? / You think some seraph up above / Is trying to rob us of our love / Because the sky's not clear? / My dear, you know there's not / Now, listen to the rain upon the rooftop" / But the wind picked up / Out where the stones stand up like thrones beside the ocean / Out where the waves make a grave of the sea / The lovers struggled in the middle of the tempest / And water angrily crawled up onto the beach / Said, "Hold my hand, and stay with me, we'll be released" / But the tide clung like an anchor to her feet / And though he tried to make the water line recede / It pulled her out into the sea / He could not break apart the waves / To bring her safely back in / He watched her hand break through the surface once / Then disappear again / Forever wait inside the sea for me / My dear, I hear you / You speak in every curling wave / And sing in every violent breeze / Someday not far away from here / My dear, I swear I'll see you / And we will hear the seraphs cry / They will still envy you and I / How they envied you and I / How they envied you and I / How they envied you and I / ________________________________________ / Name Fall Down, Never Get Back Up Again / Artist La Dispute / Album Somewhere at the Bottom of the River Between Vega and Altair"/>
