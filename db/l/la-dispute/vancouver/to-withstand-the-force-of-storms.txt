Oh, you've a pretty mouth
Leave your lips to linger on my skin
And kiss me one last time
I will roll off your tongue like a whisper

In the winter
Sleeping in the
Sutures of the
City's skin

Make yourself remember me
In cold and concrete

Oh, when will you realize
Oh, the city makes you real?
When will you realize
Your demons make you real?

Oh, you've a pretty mouth
Leave your lips to linger on my skin
And kiss me one last time
I will roll off your tongue like a whisper

In the winter
Sleeping in the
Sutures of the
City's skin

Make yourself remember me
In cold and concrete

It's the way my hands felt
Lying still beneath your dress
It's the way my hands felt

Oh, I am transparent
Oh, I am a greenhouse filled with ghosts
I am transparent, oh

Oh dear god
Oh my god

Whisper secrets
Speak in a hushed voice
The first thing that you learn
Is that you never let them hear you

In a soundproof room
In a windowless world
Keep your voice down
Or dull your words

Then put on your bedroom face for him
All pursed lips
And half-closed eyes
With pink-stained skin
Screaming for sleeping hands on downed dresses

Screaming
For dead legs come alive
For dead legs come alive

For dead legs come alive

Oh dear god
There is no excuse for me

Oh dear god
What have I done?

I still love you
But I don't love myself
