I'm reading over your shoulder
It says it in every line
In every curve and crack

It says it in every detail of your face
Unmistakably apparent in this dull light
Tracing a separate letter and forming a separate word

Twisting together
To build the same beautiful sentence
The same painful realization

The cracks in your lips
Open with the book
And the smile shows the lines in your face
Perfectly crooked
And perfectly familiar

The cracks in your lips
Open with the book
And the smile shows the lines in your face
Perfectly crooked
And perfectly familiar

And by the moment
Uncovered like a statue
Lay perfectly still
To show the cracks in your lips
Give purpose to this pattern and start to smile

Burst into flames, disappear
Before your best intentions
Can no longer hide her ears
From that which will make them bleed

Or your own two hands become too weak
To hold the blood inside the wounds

Or reality explodes before you
In a brilliant flash of spectral fire
To a thousand fragments of a past
Long dead and gone

This is remembering the last time we touched
The last time we spoke
Words ricocheting off empty tables

Vandalizing the pictures on these smoke-stained walls
And I can feel your mouth
As it opens from across the room

Your tongue and lips, forming the shape of your laughter
It's the curve of your stomach, it's the bend in your legs
It's the remnants of pages framed in the cracks of your bleeding lips
It's the curve of your stomach, it's the bend in your legs

Your crooked teeth
Oh, your crooked teeth, your crooked teeth
Oh, your crooked teeth, your crooked teeth
Oh, your crooked teeth, your crooked teeth

I'm reading over your shoulder
It says it in every line
In every curve and crack

The same stupid message in every stupid bend
In every stupid stitch
In every inch of our peeling skin

It's tracing the letters in the same sentence
It's screaming the same stupid thing
Like the howling of a plane
Playing over and over and over and over and over
And over and over and over and over and over...;
