Drivers out on the bridge
Slowing down as they go through a lane shift
Wires snap
Concrete gives
Metal twisting
And everything tumbling

At the end of the work day
Stuck in traffic, don't feel when the road sways
Underneath
Concrete gives
Metal twisting
And everything tumbling

To their partners and kids
Don't suspect anything 'til the bridge splits
Wires snap
Concrete gives
Metal twisting
And everything tumbling down

Where I sat, I saw brake lights flash
And I pictured them, all the people
Their faces in free fall, the water beneath
I pushed my palms against the table hard to see if it hurt

Were it glass, would I have shattered it?
Could I battle every impulse to panic and then win
Swim out through the metal twisting
Upward like a sculpture or some terrible beast?

People trapped in their cars
Put both feet on the glass and then kick hard
Water pours in
Seatbelts twist
River flowing
And everything going down

People under the water line
Workers sift through the wreckage of it, find
Seatbelts stuck
Water fills up
River flowing
And everything going downstream

On the dining room wall, I watched it
Play in the reflection of the television
The reversal in the mirror hung, I could see it all
How the dust clouds gather color as they billow out
Shades change shifting in the night
From the lights atop an ambulance
Like a firework's flash, then that otherworldly glow
In the smoke thrown in the aftermath blows
Almost frozen for a moment there
I could see it all

Every dust cloud
Shattered glass
Billow out on the TV
Wires snap
And the concrete gives
Metal twists up and onward

I can see it all
Every dust cloud
Shattered glass
Billow out on the TV
Wires snap
And the concrete gives in
Metal twists up and onward, I watch
And I can see it all

All the wreckage
All the cars piled
In the river and the rail yard
The metal twists
Wires snap
Concrete blocks split
And dangle from tie rods
And metal twists up

Wires sway
When a breeze blows
In the distant
Sirens glow
I can see it all

Where they look for survivors
Searchlights float
Change the color of smoke clouds
And shadows still fall
People under the water

People trapped in their cars
Kick and try to get out
People still with their seat belts on
Pets they had in the back
And car seats

And I watch it on TV lying down here
On the floor in the dining room, reversed in the mirror
Where I know I'm not dreaming now
But I know I've been sleeping
I just don't know since when
I only know that it's light outside
I only know that the rent is still late
When did they find out the concrete gave?
When did they learn that the wires snapped?
