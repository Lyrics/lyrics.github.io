    <div class="view"><article id="lyrics"><p>There were shadows in the bedroom<br/>Where the light got thrown by the lamp on the night stand<br/>On your mother's side, after midnight, still<br/>You can see it all, you can see it all</p><p>And the closet in the corner<br/>On the far back shelf with the keepsakes, she hid<br/>That box there, full of letters of regret<br/>By the pictures of the kids</p><p>You get faint recollections of your<br/>Mother's sigh, countryside drive<br/>And the landscape seen from the window of the back seat<br/>With some flowers in a basket</p><p>That afternoon after school<br/>You and your older sisters<br/>Found your parents in the kitchen at the table<br/>Father lifting off the lid of the box</p><p>And a hush fell<br/>Over everything like a funeral prayer<br/>A reverence, ancestral, heavy in the air<br/>Though you didn't understand what it meant</p><p>That they never said her name aloud around you<br/>Even sitting at the table with her things they'd kept<br/>You recall faintly cards, tiny clothes<br/>And the smell of the paint in the upstairs bedroom<br/>Until then you didn't know that's what the box had held</p><p>Your parents tiptoeing slowly around<br/>Always speaking in code</p><p>No, they never said her name aloud around you<br/>Only told you it was perfect where your sister went<br/>And you didn't understand why it hurt them<br/>So much then that she'd come and left so soon<br/>Could only guess inside your head at what a "stillbirth" meant<br/>Only knew that mother wept</p><p>You watched while father held her<br/>Said "Some things come, but can't stay here"<br/>You saw a brightness, like a light through your eyes<br/>Closed tight then she tumbled away</p><p>From here, some place<br/>To remain in the night time shadows she made<br/>To be an absence in mom<br/>A sadness hanging over her</p><p>Like some pentecostal flame<br/>Drifting on and off<br/>She was "Sister" only whispered<br/>Sometimes "Her" or "The Child We Lost"</p><p>You were visions<br/>A vagueness<br/>A faded image<br/>You were visions</p><p>You were a flame lit<br/>That burned out twice as brightly<br/>As the rest of us did<br/>When you left, you were light<br/>Then you tumbled away</p><p>There are shadows that fall<br/>Still here at a certain angle<br/>In the bedroom on the night stand<br/>By your mother's side<br/>From the light left on there</p><p>There's the box in the closet<br/>All the things kept<br/>And the landscape where she left<br/>Flowers on the grave<br/>Marble where they etched that name<br/>And mother cried the whole way home</p><p>But she never said it once out loud<br/>On the way back home from where you thought they meant<br/>When they said where sister went</p><p>After grandpa got hospice sick<br/>And he couldn't fall sleep<br/>They wheeled his stretcher bed beside her at night<br/>And I saw the light</p><p>On the day that he died<br/>By their bed in grandma's eyes<br/>While us grandkids said our goodbyes</p><p>She said, "Don't cry"<br/>Somewhere he holds her<br/>And said a name I didn't recognize<br/>And the light with all the shadows combined...;</p></article></div>
