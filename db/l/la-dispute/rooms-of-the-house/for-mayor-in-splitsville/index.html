<title>La Dispute â€“ For Mayor in Splitsville | Lyrics</title>
<meta name="description" content="Funny what you think of after a collapse / While lying in the dirt / The first thing that comes back / Is never quite what you'd have guessed / And if you could have / You probably would've said you'd check / If all your limbs were intact / Still and then try to get out / We played house with the / Neighbors in their basement / Sister made me husband / She was older so I did her bidding / I remember once their dad came in / And said, "You think this is bad? / You don't know the half" / And he laughed / It's funny what things come back / The first things you see / How he sort of smiled / Like it's only a joke, but he was lying / There was something else inside of his eyes / All those secrets people tell to little children / Are warnings that they give them / Like, "Look, I'm unhappy / Please don't make the same mistake as me" / Why are those old worn out jokes / On married life told at toasts / At receptions still? / How does it never occur / How often couples get burned / And end uncertain in Splitsville? / Funny what you think of in the wreckage / Lying there in the dirt and the dust and the glass / How you're suddenly somewhere / In the desert, in the night time / And it's gettin' close to Christmas / And then her and that movie voice she uses when she reads / "Welcome to the Land of Enchantment" from a highway sign / And it's late so you take the next exit / When that trip ended, we came back / The rent was due, I was jobless / I guess in retrospect, I should've sensed decay / Then that day, how you said / "I just don't know" and I promised / We'd rearrange things / Ro fix the mess I'd made here / But I guess in the end / We just moved furniture around / But I guess in the end / We just moved furniture around / But I guess in the end / We just moved furniture around / But I guess in the end / It sort of feels like every day it's harder / To stay happy where you are / There are all these ways to look through the fence / Into your neighbor's yard / Why even risk it? / It's safer to stay distant / When it's so hard now to just be content / Because there's always something else / Now I'm proposing my own toast / Composing my own joke for those married men / Maybe I'm miserable / I'd rather run for mayor in Splitsville / Than suffer your jokes again / ______________________________ / Name For Mayor in Splitsville / Artist La Dispute / Album Rooms of the House"/>
