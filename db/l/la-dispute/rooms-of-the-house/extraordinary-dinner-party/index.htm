<div><pre>Morning after snowstorm, stand in the silence
Almost feel reborn, all alone on the street
It's a certain sort of stillness
When the quiet surrounds you
The only sound, your shovel on concrete

I remember those piles from the snow plows
Always seemed much bigger back when I was kid
Pushed all of the snow to the end of the driveway
I was the only person up in the neighborhood
Morning after snowstorm

I turned the ignition
And I started my car
Morning after snowstorm
I scraped off my windshield
With the edge of a credit card

I remember that drive into work
Still can hear the voice coming over the radio
Listen to our experts
Give the best tips
For the next time you entertain dinner guests

I thought of the day
In a tie in the kitchen, I sat
And I watched you put make-up on
Thought of the day
In the basement when I played house

I felt ashamed
That I'd stayed in my head
In the same place for so long
Because I was afraid to change
But that's not an excuse to stay

Morning after snowstorm
I climbed up on the snowbank
And I stared at the neighborhood
Morning after snowstorm
I think I finally understood
What they meant when they said
There's a calm after the storm

Saw my grandpa at his workbench
Building grandma's bookshelf
Watched a woman walk her trash out to the street

Father alone on the highway
I heard the salt trucks
And neighbors off to work
Saw my mother
Saw how history loops
Around all of these moments
And then I saw you

In a dress there
With your eyes open wide
To put make-up on
Thought of the day
In the basement that I played house

And I felt ashamed
I'd ignored all the hands
That extended before and around me
Because I was afraid to change
But that's not an excuse to stay

It's not an excuse</pre></div>
