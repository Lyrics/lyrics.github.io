And I<br/>Am terrified that it doesn't feel painful to me yet<br/>Somewhere on top of the high rise<br/>There's a woman on the edge of a building at the ledge<br/>And traffic's backing up on 35</p><p>It's alright<br/>I will fix whatever is not<br/>The sweetness in your eyes<br/>Just sit down, please, sit down<br/>Here at the table and we'll talk<br/>Somewhere televisions light up in the night</p><p>I know things weren't right<br/>Maybe we were never cut out for the Midwest life<br/>Maybe we'd have done much better on a coast<br/>There are certain things I doubt we'll ever know</p><p>I know you were getting tired of my drinking<br/>I guess I was never cut out for the coke scene<br/>You were worried I would end up like your father<br/>And tired of the smoke and somewhere the wind blows</p><p>Somewhere a storm touches down north in Hudsonville<br/>Somewhere the coffee starts to boil on the stove<br/>And somewhere the wind blows<br/>Somewhere the river levels finally getting low<br/>Somewhere I'm up past dawn 'til<br/>Somewhere you live here still<br/>Somewhere you're already gone</p><p>Somewhere a radio is playing in a living room<br/>Says the city lacks the funds to fix the bridge</p><p>Somewhere the deer are overrun<br/>So they're introducing wolves back on the ridge</p><p>And from here in the kitchen<br/>I can hear the neighbors in the alley hanging linens<br/>And the men collect the trash bins in the street<br/>You're speaking to me but I can't understand you<br/>The coffee is burning</p><p>And all of the times that we spent<br/>That road trip out west<br/>Through desert for the rest stops<br/>The kitsch we both collect<br/>That winter the whole weekend<br/>We huddled by the stove<br/>The cabin I had rented<br/>The unexpected snow<br/>That visit for Christmas<br/>On television binges<br/>We'll see friends in Brooklyn<br/>Drive south to Richmond<br/>There's traffic on the bridge<br/>A woman on the ledge<br/>And everywhere the wind</p><p>Everything is happening at once</p></article></div>
