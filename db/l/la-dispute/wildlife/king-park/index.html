These children, our kids"</p><p>Everybody wondering how far they were<br/>From where the victims lived<br/>And I visit them, their houses<br/>Inside my dream I visit them<br/>My spirit, soaring high and high<br/>Up over King Park, leaves the crime scene<br/>Travels further back, till far before the shooting<br/>Through their windows, to their living rooms</p><p>I see them younger this time<br/>Playing games and doing homework<br/>All these marks of youth<br/>Soon transformed coldly into stone<br/>For fights and stupid feuds<br/>For ruins wrapped in gold, and</p><p>Cruelly, I recall<br/>Why I have come<br/>To find a reason<br/>But there cannot be a reason<br/>Not for death, not like this<br/>Not like this</p><p>Three days later, they made funeral plans<br/>The family<br/>Three days later, a mother<br/>Had to bury her son</p><p>Not far away, the shooter<br/>Holed up in a hotel<br/>Near to the highway<br/>With a friend and the gun<br/>That same gun</p><p>He'd fled immediately<br/>But was identified by witnesses<br/>His picture on TV<br/>Only 20 years old; they called him Grandpa<br/>He was older than the others<br/>By a year, maybe two, and<br/>He was safe for awhile<br/>Until somebody saw him there</p><p>And notified the authorities<br/>Who surrounded the hotel<br/>First arresting an accomplice<br/>While attempting to flee<br/>Then chasing him up the staircase<br/>To the floor where he'd stayed<br/>He closed the door hard behind him<br/>Locked himself in the room</p><p>They could've kicked in the door<br/>But knew the gun was still with him<br/>One he'd already used<br/>And so they feared what he'd do<br/>I floated up through the window<br/>Of a room to the west<br/>I hovered out to the hallway<br/>Tried to listen in</p><p>I heard them trying to reason<br/>Get him to open the door<br/>His uncle begging and pleading<br/>Half-collapsed to the floor<br/>He preached of hope and forgiveness<br/>Said, "There is always a chance<br/>To rectify what you've taken<br/>Make your peace in the world"</p><p>I thought to slip through the door<br/>I could've entered the room<br/>I felt the burden of murder<br/>It shook the earth to the core<br/>Felt like the world was collapsing<br/>Then we heard him speak</p><p>"Can I still get into heaven if I kill myself?<br/>Can I still get into heaven if I kill myself?<br/>Can I ever be forgiven cause I killed that kid?<br/>It was an accident, I swear it wasn't meant for him!</p><p>And if I turn it on me, if I even it out<br/>Can I still get in or will they send me to hell?<br/>Can I still get into heaven if I kill myself?"<br/>I left the hotel behind, don't want to know how it ends</p></article></div>
