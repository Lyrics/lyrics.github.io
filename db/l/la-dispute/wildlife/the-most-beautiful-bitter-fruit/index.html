It's true<br/>I've made a tale of it here<br/>Still it's a little unclear<br/>Who's been haunting who</p><p>And time can<br/>Be such a funny thing<br/>Always moving to the future<br/>Glorifying the past<br/>And amplifying the pain<br/>In frames of glass</p><p>So was our touch half as sacred as I've made it seem<br/>Or just another fabrication of a half-dream?<br/>Just those chemicals, the adolescent love<br/>Just us trying to grasp onto meaning</p><p>Onto a purpose<br/>Onto a sense that<br/>Something spiritual releases when the feeling hits<br/>And when the feeling hits</p><p>And in that moment, sparks and harps play out<br/>A sweeping melody through fog and fantasy<br/>And in that moment there's an honesty instinctive and pure<br/>But it departs like it came<br/>Rapid and bearing no more<br/>Than fleeting ecstasy of natural harmony</p><p>They fear the notes being played<br/>And try to sing along<br/>Don't be ashamed, be free to the feeling<br/>Don't be ashamed, keep feeling<br/>But find it, a body that makes sense<br/>I've felt it</p></article></div>
