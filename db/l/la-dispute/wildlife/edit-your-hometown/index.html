<title>La Dispute â€“ Edit Your Hometown | Lyrics</title>
<meta name="description" content="An outcry / To lost dreams and the sense of wonder / To the streets that raised him, say goodbye / To the hope for the home he'd been holding / Say goodbye and be gone and be great / To the friends who left when they still could / For the ones who chose to stay / To waste away unplaced / Alone and pray / To get out, to grow old, to grow strong / And leave this city / So familiar / All its places / All these memories / Turn each day more to gray / More they space out till it's / Once a year we'll catch up / Maybe less / Or else just daydreams / While he's working late / Thinks only of those friends / And when they left / Are we still friends / At all, my friends? / Can I leave? / Rewind and find a younger man / All hopes and goals and dreams alight / And bright with friendship / At the crossroads in the night / "Now make a choice" / The city said / We were barely twenty then / But while I swore it my allegiance / They chose leaving, all my friends / And now it's letters / Maybe phone calls / That come less and less each year / All addressed with wives and children / To the fool who chose to stay here / And it hurts me to know I'm alone now / And it's worse when I know that I chose it / Don't make the same mistake as me / Don't make the same mistake / And now my friends have all left / Or it's been me gone all along? / I guess we all part one day / And drop like leaves into the breeze / And ain't it wild? / Ain't it bitter? / Didn't it carry you from me? / But it's the coping with my fear / That keeps me here, see, once it's gone / Do I regret you? / You can't retrieve it / Can I forget you? / I still believe / I might get left here / I might turn 63 / Still sweeping up the gutters in the street / Or weeding concrete / Wait and see / We'll wait and see / Or rather, I will / Only me / Only me / Don't make the same mistake as me / Don't make the same mistake / Don't make the same mistake as me / Say goodbye and be gone and be great / And be done and be free / ________________________ / Name Edit Your Hometown / Artist La Dispute / Album Wildlife"/>
