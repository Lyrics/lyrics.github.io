<title>La Dispute â€“ all our bruised bodies and the whole heart shrinks | Lyrics</title>
<meta name="description" content="So now, tell me how your story goes / Have you ever suffered? / If so, did you get better or have you / Never quite recovered from it? / Did you find your lover laying / In your bedroom with another and then / Did you let it hover over you / And everything else well after the fact? / Show me all your bruises / I know everybody wears them / They broadcast the pain / How you hurt, how you reacted / Did cancer take your child? / Did your father have a heart attack? / Have you had a moment force / The whole heart to grow or retract? / Or just shrink / Does the heart shrink? / Tell me everything / Tell me everything you know / Were you told as a child / How cruel the whole world can be? / Did anybody ever tell you that? / Tell me what your purpose is? / Who it was that put you here, and why? / Did anybody really put you here at all? / And what of those necessities? / Like how to cope with tragedy and pain? / Did anybody ever show you how? / When it hits, will my heart burst or break or grow strong? / Is there really only one way to know now? / I'm not sure if I'm ready yet to find out the hard way / How strong I am, what I'm made of / I'm not sure I am ready yet to walk through the fire / I'm not sure I can handle it / Do you think if the heart keeps on shrinking / One day there will be no heart at all? / And how long does it take? / Am I better off just bursting or breaking? / 'Cause I don't see my heart getting strong / Tell your stories to me, show your bruises / Let's see what humanity is capable of handling / She lost her kid, only seven, to cancer / She answered with faith in her god and carried on, while / He was attacked by his son and was stabbed / In his stomach and his back and his arms, he showed me scars / 82 years old, told me, "I still have my daughter and my wife / And I still have my life and my son" / Tell me what your worst fears are / I bet they look a lot like mine / Tell me what you think about / When you can't fall asleep at night / Tell me that you're struggling / Tell me that you're scared / No, tell me that you're terrified of life / Tell me that it's difficult / To not think of death sometimes / Tell me how you lost / Tell me how he left / Tell me how she left / Tell me how you lost everything that you had / Tell me it ain't ever coming back / Tell me about God / Tell me about love / Tell me that it's all of the above / Say you think of everything in fear / I bet you're not the only one who does / Everyone in the world comes at some point to suffering / I wonder when I will, I wonder / Everyone is out searching for someone or something / I wonder what I'll find, I wonder / Everyone in the world comes at some point to suffering / I wonder when I will, I wonder / Everyone is out searching for someone or something / I wonder what I'll find, I wonder / I wonder what I'll find, I wonder / I wonder what I'll find / I wonder what I'll find / I wonder what I'll find / ________________________________________________________ / Name all our bruised bodies and the whole heart shrinks / Artist La Dispute / Album Wildlife"/>
