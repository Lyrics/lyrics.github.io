<div><pre>From the top to the bottom (Bottom to top I stop)
At the core I've forgotten (In the middle of my thoughts)
Taken far from my safety (The picture's there)
The memory won't escape me (But why should I care?)

From the top to the bottom (Bottom to top I stop)
At the core I've forgotten (In the middle of my thoughts)
Taken far from my safety (The picture's there)
The memory won't escape me (But why should I care?)

There's a place so dark, you can't see the end
Skies cock back and shock that which can't defend
The rain then sends dripping, acidic questions
Forcefully, the power of suggestion
Then with the eyes shut
Looking through the rust and rot n' dust
A small spot of light floods the floor
And pours over the rusted world of pretend
And the eyes ease open and it's dark again

From the top to the bottom (Bottom to top I stop)
At the core I've forgotten (In the middle of my thoughts)
Taken far from my safety (The picture's there)
The memory won't escape me (But why should I care?)

In the memory you'll find me
Eyes burning up
The darkness holding me tightly
Until the sun rises up

Moving all around, screaming of the ups and downs
Pollution manifested in perpetual sound
The wheels go round and the sunset creeps behind street lamps
Chain link and concrete
A little piece of paper with a picture drawn
Floats on down the street 'til the wind is gone
And the memory now is like the picture was then
When the paper's crumpled up, it can't be perfect again

From the top to the bottom (Bottom to top I stop)
At the core I've forgotten (In the middle of my thoughts)
Taken far from my safety (The picture's there)
The memory won't escape me (But why should I care?)

From the top to the bottom (Bottom to top I stop)
At the core I've forgotten (In the middle of my thoughts)
Taken far from my safety (The picture's there)
The memory won't escape me (But why should I care?)

In the memory you'll find me
Eyes burning up
The darkness holding me tightly
Until the sun rises up

Now you've got me caught in the act
You bring the thought back
I'm telling you that I see it right through you

Now you've got me caught in the act
You bring the thought back (You bring the thought back)
I'm telling you that I see it right through you (See it right through you)

Now you've got me caught in the act
You bring the thought back (You bring the thought back)
I'm telling you that I see it right through you

Now you've got me caught in the act (Oooh)
You bring the thought back
I'm telling you that I see it right through you

Now you've got me caught in the act (Oooh)
You bring the thought back
I'm telling you that I see it right through you

Now you've got me caught in the act (Oooh)
You bring the thought back
I'm telling you that I see it right through you

Now you've got me caught in the act (Oooh)
You bring the thought back
I'm telling you that I see it right through you

In the memory you'll find me
Eyes burning up
The darkness holding me tightly
Until the sun rises up

In the memory you will find me
Eyes burning up
The darkness holding me tightly
Until the sun rises up</pre></div>
