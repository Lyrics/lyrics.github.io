<title>Linkin Park â€“ By Myself | Lyrics</title>
<meta name="description" content="What do I do to ignore them behind me? / Do I follow my instincts blindly? / Do I hide my pride from these bad dreams? / And give in to sad thoughts that are maddening? / Do I sit here and try to stand it / Or do I try to catch them red-handed? / Do I trust some and get fooled by phoniness? / Or do I trust nobody and live in loneliness? / Because I can't hold on when I'm stretched so thin / I make the right moves, but I'm lost within / I put on my daily facade, but then / I just end up getting hurt again by myself / (Myself) / I ask why (But in my mind, I find) / I can't rely on myself (Myself) / I ask why (But in my mind, I find) / I can't rely on myself / I can't hold on (To what I want when I'm stretched so thin) / It's all too much to take in / I can't hold on (To anything, watching everything spin) / With thoughts of failure sinking in / If I turn my back, I'm defenseless / And to go blind leaves you senseless / If I hide my pride and let it all go on / Then they'll take from me 'til everything is gone / And if I let them go, I'll be outdone / But if I try to catch them, I'll be outrun / If I'm killed by the questions like a cancer / Then I'll be buried in the silence of the answer by myself / (Myself) / I ask why (But in my mind, I find) / I can't rely on myself (Myself) / I ask why (But in my mind, I find) / I can't rely on myself / I can't hold on (To what I want when I'm stretched so thin) / It's all too much to take in / I can't hold on (To anything, watching everything spin) / With thoughts of failure sinking in / How do you think I've lost so much? / I'm so afraid, I'm out of touch / How do you expect I will know what to do / When all I know is what you tell me to? / Don't you (Know?) / I can't tell you how to make it (Go) / No matter what I do, how hard I (Try) / I can't seem to convince myself (Why) / I'm stuck on the outside / Don't you (Know?) / I can't tell you how to make it (Go) / No matter what I do, how hard I (Try) / I can't seem to convince myself (Why) / I'm stuck on the outside / I can't hold on (To what I want when I'm stretched so thin) / It's all too much to take in / I can't hold on (To anything, watching everything spin) / With thoughts of failure sinking in / I can't hold on (To what I want when I'm stretched so thin) / It's all too much to take in / I can't hold on (To anything, watching everything spin) / With thoughts of failure sinking... / _______________ / Name By Myself / Artist Linkin Park / Album Hybrid Theory"/>
