    <div class="view"><pre>You know what I mean?
You could put a label on a life, put a label on a lifestyle
(Sometimes)
You know, put a label on how you wake up every morning and go to bed at night

(Hybrid)
I've been diggin' into crates ever since I was livin' in space
Before the rat-race, before monkeys had human traits
I mastered numerology and Big Bang theology
Performed lobotomies with telekinetic psychology
Invented the mic so I could start blessin' it
Chin-checkin' kids to make my point like an impressionist
Many men have tried to shake us
But I twist mic cords in double helixes and show them what I'm made of
I buckle knees like leg braces
Cast the spell of instrumental-ness and all of you MCs who hate us
So you can try on
Leave you without a shoulder to cry on
From now to infinity let icons be bygones
I fire-bomb, ghostly notes haunt this
I tried threats but moved on to a promise
I stomp shit with or without an accomplice
And run the gauntlet with whoever that wants this

High Voltage
The unforgettable sound
High Voltage
Bringing you up and taking you down
High Voltage
Coming at you from every side
High Voltage
Making the rhythm and rhyme collide

(Akira)
I put a kink in the backbones of clones with microphones
Never satisfy my rhyme jones
Sprayin' bright day over what you might say
My blood type's Krylon Technicolor type A
On highways ride with road rage
Pages of wind and cages of tin that bounce all around
Surround sound devouring the scene
Subliminal gangrene paintings
Overall the same thing
Sing song karaoke copy bullshit
Break bones verbally with sticks and stone tactics
Fourth dimension, combat convention
Write rhymes at ease while the track stands at attention
Meant to put you away with the pencil-pistol, official 16-line the rhyme missile
While you risk your all, I pick out all your flaws
Spittin' "rah blah blah blah"
You can say you saw

High Voltage
The unforgettable sound
High Voltage
Bringing you up and taking you down
High Voltage
Coming at you from every side
High Voltage
Making the rhythm and rhyme collide

High Voltage
The unforgettable sound
High Voltage
Bringing you up and taking you down
High Voltage
Coming at you from every side
High Voltage
Making the rhythm and rhyme collide

And like the rock and rap, you know what I mean?
People acting like, you know, "wow that's a new invention, that shit's brand new"
We're constantly evolving, it is constantly changing
(Sometimes)
There's a lot of change
Everybody's always up with labels, there ain't no label for this shit
They're always gonna try to put a label on it, try to create something so they can water it down

Sometimes I feel like a prophet
Misunderstood, under the gun like a new disease

Sometimes I feel like a prophet
Misunderstood, under the gun like a new disease

High Voltage
The unforgettable sound
High Voltage
Bringing you up and taking you down
High Voltage
Coming at you from every side
High Voltage
Making the rhythm and rhyme collide

High Voltage
The unforgettable sound
High Voltage
Bringing you up and taking you down
High Voltage
Coming at you from every side
High Voltage
Making the rhythm and rhyme collide

High Voltage
The unforgettable sound
High Voltage
Bringing you up and taking you down
High Voltage
Coming at you from every side
High Voltage
Making the rhythm and rhyme collide

High Voltage
The unforgettable sound
High Voltage
Bringing you up and taking you down
High Voltage
Coming at you from every side
High Voltage
Making the rhythm and rhyme collide

You know what I mean?
You could put a label on a lifestyle</pre></div>
