<title>Linkin Park â€“ A Place For My Head | Lyrics</title>
<meta name="description" content="I watch how the moon sits in the sky on a dark night / Shining with the light from the sun / The sun doesn't give life to the moon / Assuming the moon's going to owe it one / It makes me think of how you act to me / You"/>
