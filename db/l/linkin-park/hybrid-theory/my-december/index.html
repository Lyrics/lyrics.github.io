    <div class="view"><div id="lyrics">This is my December
This is my time of the year
This is my December
This is all so clear

This is my December
This is my snow covered home
This is my December
This is me all alone

(And I)
Just wish that I didn't feel like there was something I missed
(And I)
Take back all the things I said to make you feel like that
(And I)
Just wish that I didn't feel like there was something I missed
(And I)
Take back all the things that I said to you

And I'd
Give it all away, just to have somewhere to go to
Give it all away, to have someone to come home to

This is my December
These are my snow covered dreams
This is me pretending
This is all I need

(And I)
Just wish that I didn't feel like there was something I missed
(And I)
Take back all the things I said to make you feel like that
(And I)
Just wish that I didn't feel like there was something I missed
(And I)
Take back all the things that I said to you

And I'd
Give it all away, just to have somewhere to go to
Give it all away, to have someone to come home to

This is my December
This is my time of the year
This is my December
This is all so clear

Give it all away, just to have somewhere to go to
Give it all away, to have someone to come home to
Give it all away, just to have somewhere to go to
Give it all away, to have someone to come home to</div></div>
