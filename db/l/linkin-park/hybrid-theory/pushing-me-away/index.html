    <div class="view"><pre>I've lied to you
The same way that I always do
This is the last smile
That I'll fake for the sake of being with you
(Everything falls apart, even the people who never frown eventually break down)
The sacrifice of hiding in a lie
(Everything has to end, you'll soon find we're out of time left to watch it all unwind)
The sacrifice is never knowing

Why I never walked away
Why I played myself this way
Now I see your testing me
Pushes me away
Why I never walked away
Why I played myself this way
Now I see your testing me
Pushes me away

I've tried like you
To do everything you wanted to
This is the last time
I'll take the blame for the sake of being with you
(Everything falls apart, even the people who never frown eventually break down)
The sacrifice of hiding in a lie
(Everything has to end, you'll soon find we're out of time left to watch it all unwind)
The sacrifice is never knowing

Why I never walked away
Why I played myself this way
Now I see your testing me
Pushes me away
Why I never walked away
Why I played myself this way
Now I see your testing me
Pushes me away

(We're all out of time, this is how we find how it all unwinds)
The sacrifice of hiding in a lie
(We're all out of time, this is how we find how it all unwinds)
The sacrifice is never knowing

Why I never walked away
Why I played myself this way
Now I see your testing me
Pushes me away
Why I never walked away
Why I played myself this way
Now I see your testing me
Pushes me away
Pushes me away</pre></div>
