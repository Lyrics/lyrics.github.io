<title>Linkin Park â€“ The Little Things Give You Away | Lyrics</title>
<meta name="description" content="Water grey / Through the windows, up the stairs / Chilling rain, like an ocean everywhere / Don't want to reach for me, do you? / I mean nothing to you / The little things give you away / And now there will be no mistaking / The levees are breaking / All you've ever wanted / Was someone to truly look up to you / And six feet underwater, I do / Hope decays / Generations disappear / Washed away as a nation simply stares / Don't want to reach for me, do you? / I mean nothing to you / The little things give you away / But now there will be no mistaking / The levees are breaking / All you've ever wanted / Was someone to truly look up to you / And six feet underwater, I do / All you've ever wanted / Was someone to truly look up to you / And six feet underground, now I / Now I do / The little things give you away / The little things give you away / The little things give you away / The little things give you away / (All you've ever wanted was someone to truly look up to you) / The little things give you away, the little things give you away / (All you've ever wanted was someone to truly look up to you) / The little things give you away, the little things give you away / (All you've ever wanted was someone to truly look up to you) / The little things give you away, the little things give you away / (All you've ever wanted was someone to truly look up to you) / The little things give you away, the little things give you away / (All you've ever wanted was someone to truly look up to you) / The little things give you away, the little things give you away / (All you've ever wanted was someone to truly look up to you) / The little things give you away, the little things give you away / _____________________________________ / Name The Little Things Give You Away / Artist Linkin Park / Album Minutes To Midnight"/>
