<title>Linkin Park â€“ Leave Out All The Rest | Lyrics</title>
<meta name="description" content="I dreamed I was missing / You were so scared / But no one would listen / 'Cause no one else cared / After my dreaming / I woke with this fear / What am I leaving / When I'm done here? / So if you're asking me I want you to know / When my time comes / Forget the wrong that I've done / Help me leave behind some / Reasons to be missed / And don't resent me / And when you're feeling empty / Keep me in your memory / Leave out all the rest / Leave out all the rest / Don't be afraid / I've taken my beating / I've shed what I made / I'm strong on the surface / Not all the way through / I've never been perfect / But neither have you / So if you're asking me I want you to know / When my time comes / Forget the wrong that I've done / Help me leave behind some / Reasons to be missed / Don't resent me / And when you're feeling empty / Keep me in your memory / Leave out all the rest / Leave out all the rest / Forgetting / All the hurt inside you've learned to hide so well / Pretending / Someone else can come and save me from myself / I can't be who you are / When my time comes / Forget the wrong that I've done / Help me leave behind some / Reasons to be missed / Don't resent me / And when you're feeling empty / Keep me in your memory / Leave out all the rest / Leave out all the rest / Forgetting / All the hurt inside you've learned to hide so well / Pretending / Someone else can come and save me from myself / I can't be who you are / I can't be who you are / ____________________________ / Name Leave Out All The Rest / Artist Linkin Park / Album Minutes To Midnight"/>
