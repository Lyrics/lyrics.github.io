Are you lost in your lies?
Do you tell yourself I don't realize?
Your crusade's a disguise,
Replaced freedom with fear, you trade money for lives
I'm aware of what you've done

No, no more sorrow!
I've paid for your mistakes!
Your time is borrowed!
Your time has come to be replaced!

I see pain, I see need,
I see liars and thieves abuse power with greed
I had hope, I believed,
But I'm beginning to think that I've been deceived
You will pay for what you've done!

No, no more sorrow!
I've paid for your mistakes!
Your time is borrowed!
Your time has come to be replaced!

Thieves and hypocrites!
Thieves and hypocrites!
Thieves and hypocrites!

No, no more sorrow!
I've paid for your mistakes!
Your time is borrowed!
Your time has come to be replaced!
No more sorrow!
I've paid for your mistakes!
Your time is borrowed!
Your time has come to be replaced!
Your time has come to be replaced!
Your time has come to be erased!
