In this farewell, there's no blood, there's no alibi
'Cause I've drawn regret from the truth of a thousand lies
So let mercy come and wash away what I've done

I'll face myself to cross out what I've become
Erase myself and let go of what I've done

Put to rest what you thought of me
While I clean this slate with the hands of uncertainty
So let mercy come, and wash away what I've done

I'll face myself to cross out what I've become
Erase myself and let go of what I've done

For what I've done, I'll start again and whatever pain may come
Today this ends, I'm forgiving what I've done
I'll face myself to cross out what I've become
Erase myself and let go of what I've done

(Na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na)
What I've done
(Na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na)
Forgiving what I've done
(Na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na, na-na-na)
