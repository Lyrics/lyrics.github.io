My insides all turned to ash
So slow
And blew away as I collapsed
So cold
A black wind took them away
From sight
And held the darkness over day
That night

And the clouds above move closer
Looking so dissatisfied
But the heartless wind kept blowing, blowing

I used to be my own protection
But not now
'Cause my path has lost direction
Somehow
A black wind took you away
From sight
And held the darkness over day
That night

And the clouds above move closer
Looking so dissatisfied
And the ground below grew colder
As they put you down inside
But the heartless wind kept blowing, blowing

So now you're gone
And I was wrong
I never knew what it was like
To be alone

On a Valentine's day
On a Valentine's day
On a Valentine's day
On a Valentine's day

On a Valentine's day
(I used to be my own protection)
On a Valentine's day
(But not now)
On a Valentine's day
('Cause my mind has lost direction)
On a Valentine's day
(Somehow)

On a Valentine's day
(I used to be my own protection)
On a Valentine's day
(But not now)
On a Valentine's day
('Cause my mind has lost direction)
On a Valentine's day
(Somehow).
