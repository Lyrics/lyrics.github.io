<title>Linkin Park â€“ Don't Stay | Lyrics</title>
<meta name="description" content="Sometimes I need to remember just to breathe / Sometimes I need you to stay away from me / Sometimes I'm in disbelief I didn't know / Somehow I need you to go / Don't stay / Forget our memories / Forget our possibilities / What you were changing me into / Just give me myself back and don't stay / Forget our memories / Forget our possibilities / Take all your faithlessness with you / Just give me myself back and don't stay / Sometimes I feel like I trusted you too well / Sometimes I just feel like screaming at myself / Sometimes I'm in disbelief I didn't know / Somehow I need to be alone / Don't stay / Forget our memories / Forget our possibilities / What you were changing me into / Just give me myself back and don't stay / Forget our memories / Forget our possibilities / Take all your faithlessness with you / Just give me myself back and don't stay / I don't need you anymore / I don't want to be ignored / I don't need one more day of you wasting me away / I don't need you anymore / I don't want to be ignored / I don't need one more day / Of you wasting me away with no apologies / Don't stay / Forget our memories / Forget our possibilities / What you were changing me into / Just give me myself back and don't stay / Forget our memories / Forget our possibilities / Take all your faithlessness with you / Just give me myself back and don't stay / Don't stay / Don't stay / ________________ / Name Don't Stay / Artist Linkin Park / Album Meteora"/>
