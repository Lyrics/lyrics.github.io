<title>Linkin Park â€“ Numb | Lyrics</title>
<meta name="description" content="I'm tired of being what you want me to be / Feeling so faithless, lost under the surface / Don't know what you're expecting of me / Put under the pressure of walking in your shoes / (Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow) / Every step that I take is another mistake to you / (Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow) / I've become so numb, I can't feel you there / I've become so tired; so much more aware / I'm becoming this, all I want to do / Is be more like me and be less like you / Can't you see that you're smothering me? / Holding too tightly; afraid to lose control / 'Cause everything that you thought I would be / Has fallen apart right in front of you / (Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow) / Every step that I take is another mistake to you / (Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow) / And every second I waste is more than I can take / I've become so numb, I can't feel you there / I've become so tired; so much more aware / I'm becoming this, all I want to do / Is be more like me and be less like you / And I know I may end up failing too / But I know you were just like me / With someone disappointed in you / I've become so numb, I can't feel you there / I've become so tired; so much more aware / I'm becoming this, all I want to do / Is be more like me and be less like you / I've become so numb, I can't feel you there / (I'm tired of being what you want me to be) / I've become so numb, I can't feel you there / (I'm tired of being what you want me to be) / __________ / Name Numb / Artist Linkin Park / Album Meteora"/>
