<title>Linkin Park â€“ Hit The Floor | Lyrics</title>
<meta name="description" content="There are just too many times that people have tried to look inside of me / Wondering what I think of you and I protect you out of courtesy / Too many times that I've held on when I needed to push away / Afraid to say what was on my mind, afraid to say what I need to say / Too many things that you've said about me when I'm not around / You think having the upper hand means you've gotta keep putting me down / But I've had too many stand-offs with you, it's about as much as I can stand / So I'm waiting util the upper hand is mine / One minute you're on top, the next you're not, watch it drop / Making your heart stop just before you hit the floor / One minute you're on top, the next you're not, missed your shot / Making your heart stop, you think you've won and then it's all gone / So many people like me put so much trust in all your lies / So concerned with what you think to just say what we feel inside / So many people like me walk on eggshells all day long / All I know is that all I want is to feel like I'm not stepped on / There are so many things you say that make me feel you crossed the line / What goes up will surely fall and I'm counting down the time / 'Cause I've had so many stand-offs with you, it's about as much as I can stand / So I'm waiting until the upper hand is mine / One minute you're on top, the next you're not, watch it drop / Making your heart stop just before you hit the floor / One minute you're on top, the next you're not, missed your shot / Making your heart stop, you think you've won and then it's all gone / And then it's all gone; And then it's all gone; And then it's all gone / Now it's all gone / I know I'll never trust a single thing you say / You knew your lies would divide us but you lied anyway / And all the lies have got you floating up above us all / But what goes up has got to fall / One minute you're on top, the next you're not, watch it drop / Making your heart stop just before you hit the floor / One minute you're on top, the next you're not, missed your shot / Making your heart stop, you think you've won and then it's all gone / And then it's all gone; And then it's all gone; And then it's all gone / Now it's all gone / ___________________ / Name Hit The Floor / Artist Linkin Park / Album Meteora"/>
