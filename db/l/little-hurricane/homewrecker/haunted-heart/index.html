<title>Little Hurricane â€“ Haunted Heart | Lyrics</title>
<meta name="description" content="I'll be your thief in the night so I can steal you. / I'll be your church where you pray so I can heal you. / I'll be your lover where you lay so I can feel you. / I'll be your sunlight in your day so I can see you. / Oh, you'll be my life when I am dead, / I'll be your calm in the storm ahead. / You'll be the beat in my heart, when there is none. / You'll be the air in my lungs, when my breath is done. / You'll be the tears I can't cry, when you're weeping. / You're my only reason to keep from sleeping. / Oh, you'll be my life when I am dead, / I'll be your calm in the storm ahead. / Tell my woman that I try / To stay close, still by her side. / You'll be my life when I am dead, / I'll be your calm in the storm ahead. / Tell my woman that I try / To stay close, still by her side. / ___________________ / Name Haunted Heart / Artist Little Hurricane / Album Homewrecker"/>
