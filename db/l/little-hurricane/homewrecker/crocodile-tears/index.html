    <div class="view"><div id="lyrics">I'll blow you a kiss from across the room.
I'll let it miss so you don't assume.
Please tell me that you want me and need me.
Doesn't matter if you don't believe me.
I have no one to call me "baby".
It sure is sad no one calls you lately.
I try to run but I don't know how to get there.
Keep on running, you're going nowhere.

And you fear the sunrise will dry your eyes,
Your crocodile tears

I just need a man who will stay.
You can save it for a rainy day, ye.
Won't you help me get my life on track?
I'd oblige but you stabbed me in back.
Ride with me, I'm headed south.
I can't believe a single word from your mouth.
You and me are like biscuits and gravy.
Now I know that you're crazy.

And you fear the sunrise will dry your eyes,
Your crocodile tears, yea

I can't believe a word you say,
But you can save it for a rainy day.
Well, hard to say not once, but twice.
No, you wan't take your own advice.</div></div>
