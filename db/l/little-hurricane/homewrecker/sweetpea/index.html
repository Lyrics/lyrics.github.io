    <div class="view"><div id="lyrics">I put on my best suit to come down and see you,
I sit by your side every other day at a time.
And they say that I'm crazy,
They just can't see what you mean to me.
All I need is to be with you.

Now that you're gone I just can't move on.
For 62 years, I've loved you, my dear.
And I miss you something terrible, this heartache's unbearable.
Why'd you go and leave me? I want you back,
My sweet pea.

I can't wear that same suit, out on the town without you.
Waiting to find that same look in her eyes.
I found a new honey,
But she'll never mean what you meant to me.
You still are all of me.

My heart feels wrong, life still goes on.
Keep fighting this pain, you're so far away.
Still miss you something terrible, this heartache's unbearable.
Why'd you go and leave me? I want you back,
My sweet pea.</div></div>
