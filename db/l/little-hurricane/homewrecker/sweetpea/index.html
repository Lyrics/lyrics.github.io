<title>Little Hurricane â€“ Sweetpea | Lyrics</title>
<meta name="description" content="I put on my best suit to come down and see you, / I sit by your side every other day at a time / And they say that I'm crazy, / They just can't see what you mean to me / All I need is to be with you / Now that you're gone, just can't move on / For 62 years, I've loved you, my dear. / And I miss you something terrible, this heartache's unbearable / Why'd you go and leave me? I want you back, my sweet pea / I can't wear that same suit, out on the town without you / Waiting to find that same look in her eyes / I found a new honey, / But she'll never mean what you meant to me / You still are all of me. / My heart feels wrong, life still goes on. / Keep fighting this pain, you're so far away. / Still miss you something terrible, this heartache's unbearable. / Why'd you go and leave me? I want you back, my sweet pea / ______________ / Name Sweetpea / Artist Little Hurricane / Album Homewrecker"/>
