    <div class="view"><pre>No one knows what it's like, to be the bad man
To be the sad man, behind blue eyes
And no one knows what it's like, to be hated
To be fated, to telling only lies

But my dreams, they aren't as empty
As my conscience seems to be
I have hours, only lonely
My love is vengeance, that's never free

No one knows what it's like, to feel these feelings
Like I do, and I blame you (you, you, you)
No one bites back as hard, on their anger
None of my pain and woe, can show through (through, through, through)

But my dreams, they aren't as empty
As my conscience seems to be
I have hours, only lonely
My love is vengeance, that's never free

Discover, L.I.M.P. say it
Discover, L.I.M.P. say it
Discover, L.I.M.P. say it
Discover, L.I.M.P. say it
Discover

No one knows what it's like, to be mistreated
To be defeated, behind blue eyes (blue eyes, blue eyes, blue eyes)
And no one knows how to say, that they're sorry
And don't worry, I'm not telling lies (lies, lies)

But my dreams, they aren't as empty
As my conscience seems to be
I have hours, only lonely
My love is vengeance, that's never free

No one knows what it's like, to be the bad man
To be the sad man, behind blue eyes</pre></div>
