<title>Lamb of God â€“ Laid to Rest | Lyrics</title>
<meta name="description" content="If there was a single day I could live / A single breath I could take / I'd trade all the others away / The blood's on the wall / So you might as well just admit it / And bleach out the stains / Commit to forgetting it / You're better off empty and blank / Than left with a single pathetic trace of this / Smother another failure / Lay this to rest / Console yourself / You're better alone / Destroy yourself / See who gives a fuck / Absorb yourself / You're better alone / Destroy yourself / I'll chain you to the truth / For the truth shall set you free / I'll turn the screws of vengeance / And bury you with honesty / I'll make all your dreams come to life / Then slay them as quickly as they came / Smother another failure / Lay this to rest / Console yourself / You're better alone / Destroy yourself / See who gives a fuck / Absorb yourself / You're better alone / Destroy yourself / See who gives a fuck / See who gives a fuck / See who gives a fuck / Failure / If there was a day I could live / If there was a single breath I could take / I'd trade all the others away / I'd trade all the others away / __________________ / Name Laid to Rest / Artist Lamb of God / Album Ashes Of The Wake"/>
