Whoever appeals to the law against his fellow man is either a fool or a coward.
Whoever cannot take care of himself without that law is both.
For a wounded man shall say to his assailant: "If I live, I will kill you. If I die, you are forgiven."
Such is the Rule of Honor.

Broken the paradigm
An example must be set
Invoke the siren song and sign the death warrant
This is what has been wrought for thirty pieces of silver
The tongues of men and angels bought by a beloved betrayer

I am the result what's better left unspoken
Violence begins to mend what was broken
You've been talking
I've been all ears

Words meant to dwell in darkness shall never see the light of day
Words can be broken, so can bones
Execute the mandate
Mouth full of dirt, your name is removed from the registry
St. Peter greets with empty eyes, then turns and locks the gate

I am the result what's better left unspoken
Violence begins to mend what was broken
You've been talking
I've been all ears

Omerta

Cheaply venal, stupidly verbose
A slip of the tongue, a slit of the throat
Six feet under with no marker
Keep my name from your mouth forever
Free speech for the living
Dead men tell no tales
Your laughing finger will never point again

Omerta

Sing for me now
