Blank stares from broken men
So withered from the poisons
They can't remember when
There were once honest reasons
It's all a lie, it died a hundred thousands miles ago
Pretending I'm still here

Justify
What I've become
Sanctify
What I've become

Amazing disgrace, how sweet the sound
That saved a wretch like me
Better lost if this is found
Best blinded, never to see

The race to save face
Nothing now is what
We meant it to be
Pretending I'm still here

It's a system now
Intertwined
Take your place in the line to be ground by the gears of the masterpiece
Betrayal

Justify
What I've become
Sanctify
What I've become

Suffered consequence
It's been so long since any piece of this made any kind of sense
You anoint the king, I'll burn everything down to ashes
You giveth, I taketh away
You giveth, I taketh away

It's a system now
Intertwined
Take your place in the line to be ground by the gears of the masterpiece
Betrayal
