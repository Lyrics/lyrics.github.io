    <div class="view"><pre>Have you ever felt the future is the past
But you don't know how?
A reflected dream of a captured time
Is it really now is it really happening?

Don't know why I feel this way have I dreamt this time this place?
Something vivid comes again into my mind
And I think I've seen your face seen this room been in this place
Something vivid comes again into my mind

All my hopes and expectations looking for an explanation
Have I found my destination? I just can't take no more

The dream is true the dream is true
The dream is true the dream is true

Think I've heard your voice before think I've said these words before
Something makes me feel I just might lose my mind
Am I still inside my dream? Is this a new reality
Something makes me feel that I have lost my mind

All my hopes and expectations looking for an explanation
Coming to the realization that I can't take no more

I only dream in black and white I only dream 'cause I'm alive
I only dream in black and white to save me from myself
I only dream in black and white I only dream 'cause I'm alive
I only dream in black and white please save me from myself

The dream is true the dream is true
The dream is true the dream is true

I get up put on the light dreading the on coming night
Scared to fall asleep and dream the dream again
Nothing that I contemplate nothing that I can compare
To letting loose the demons deep inside my head

Dread to think what might be stirring that my dream is reoccurring
Got to keep away myself from drifting saving me from myself

I only dream in black and white I only dream 'cause I'm alive
I only dream in black and white to save me from myself
I only dream in black and white I only dream 'cause I'm alive
I only dream in black and white please save me from myself

Lost in a dream of mirrors lost in a paradox
Lost and time is spinning lost a nightmare I retrace

Lost a hell that I revisit lost another time and place
Lost a parallel existence lost a nightmare I retrace

I only dream in black and white I only dream 'cause I'm alive
I only dream in black and white to save me from myself
I only dream in black and white I only dream 'cause I'm alive
I only dream in black and white please save me from myself

Ohh oo oo ohh
Ohh oo oo ohh
Ohh oo oo ohh

I only dream in black and white I only dream 'cause I'm alive
I only dream in black and white to save me from myself
I only dream in black and white I only dream 'cause I'm alive
I only dream in black and white to save me from myself

The dream is true the dream is true
The dream is true the dream is true</pre></div>
