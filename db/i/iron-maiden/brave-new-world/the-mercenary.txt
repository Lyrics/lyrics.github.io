Pay to kill, die to lose
Hunter, hunted which are you
Diablo comes again
To make trophies out of men

Lose your skin, lose your skull
One by one the sack is full
In the heat dehydrate
Know which breath will be your last

Nowhere to run, nowhere to hide
You've got to kill to stay alive
Nowhere to run, nowhere to hide
You've got to kill to stay alive

Show them no fear, show them no pain
Show them no fear, show them no pain
Show them no fear, show them no pain
Show them no fear, show them no pain

Human heart, human mind
Intellect intertwined
Focus sharp in the night
Watch the jungle burning bright

Toe to toe throw the line
Everyone's caught hand tied
Iron will Iron fist
How could it have come to this?

Nowhere to run, nowhere to hide
You've got to kill to stay alive
Nowhere to run, nowhere to hide
You've got to kill to stay alive

Show them no fear, show them no pain
Show them no fear, show them no pain
Show them no fear, show them no pain
Show them no fear, show them no pain
