I have sailed to many lands now I make my final journey
On the bow i stand, west is where i go
Through the night i plough still my heart calculate and pray
As the compass swings my will is strong
I will not be led astray

Mysteries of time clouds that hide the sun
But I know, I know

I see the ghosts of navigators but they're lost
As they sail into the sunset they'll count the cost
As their skeletons accusing emerge from the sea
The sirens of the rocks, they beckon me

Take my heart and set it free
Carried forward by the waves
Nowhere left to run, Navigator's son
Chasing rainbows all my days

Where I go I do not know
I only know the place I've been
Dreams they come and go, ever shall be so
Nothing's real until you feel

I steer between the crashing rocks, the sirens call my name
Lash my hands onto the helm, blood surging with the strain
I will not fail now as sunrise comes the darkness left behind
For eternity I follow on there is no other way

Mysteries of time clouds that hide the sun
But I know, I know

I see the ghosts of navigators but they're lost
As they sail into the sunset they'll count the cost
As their skeletons accusing emerge from the sea
The sirens of the rocks, they beckon me

Take my heart and set it free
Carried forward by the waves
Nowhere left to run, Navigator's son
Chasing rainbows all my days

Where I go I do not know
I only know the place I've been
Dreams they come and go, ever shall be so
Nothing's real until you feel
