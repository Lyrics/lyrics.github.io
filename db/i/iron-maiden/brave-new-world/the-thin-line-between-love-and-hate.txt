When a person turns to wrong
Is it a want to be, belong?
Part of things at any cost
At what price a life is lost

At what point do we begin
Fighter spirit a will to win
But what makes a man decide
Take the wrong or righteous road

There's a thin line between love and hate
Wider divide that you can see between good and bad
There's a gray place between black and white
But everyone does have the right to choose the path that he takes

We all like to put the blame
On society these days
But what kind of good or bad
A new generation brings

Sometimes take just more than that
To survive be good at heart
There is evil in some of us
No matter what will never change

I will hope, my soul will fly
So I will live forever
Heart will die, my soul will fly
And I will live forever

Just a few small tears between
Someone happy and one sad
Just a thin line drawn between
Being a genius or insane

At what age begin to learn
Of which way out we will turn
There's a long and winding road
And the trail is there to burn

There's a thin line between love and hate
Wider divide that you can see between good and bad
There's a gray place between black and white
But everyone does have the right to choose the path that he takes

I will hope, my soul will fly
So I will live forever
Heart will die, my soul will fly
And I will live forever

I will hope, my soul will fly
So I will live forever
Heart will die, my soul will fly
And I will live forever

The thin line between love and hate
