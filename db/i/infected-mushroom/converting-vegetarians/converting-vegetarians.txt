This is the time of the revolution
Cooking the next step
Converting vegetarians
Minding the gap since 1996

This is the time of the revolution
Keeping it in the right track
Feeling it in my mind back
Seeing it every day every day

This is the time of the revolution
Keeping it in the right track
Feeling it in my mind back
Seeing it every day, aaah

I wake up! And my mind's out
Never again will I sell out
Converting vegetarians
Into the midnight, giving it to you
I don't know, it just feels right

And my mind's out
Never again will I sell out
Converting vegetarians
Into the midnight, giving it to you
I don't know, it just feels right
