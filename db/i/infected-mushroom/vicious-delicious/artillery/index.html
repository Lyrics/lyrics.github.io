<title>Infected Mushroom â€“ Artillery | Lyrics</title>
<meta name="description" content="The three-dimensional professional projections of spectral light / Connected room, selection air-tight / The isolated, the decisive, victory stimulated / The non-simulated patterns of flight originated / Now I'm a carnivore on a tour of duty / My band of brothers in full metal jackets establish cruelty / Black magic conjurer, attack through the monitor / Destruction of assumption, one thing I can promise ya / Impact, crash, with cold shards of glass / Ritualistic annihilators -- murder your cast / The future from the past, that last that feel / The seventh seal broken in half, ceremony is real / Become obsolete, high-strung from a beat / A strong minded individual delivering defeat / Blood rivers in the street, keep flowing no retreat / Deep omens keep opponents speech limited repeat / You're opening the door to the corridor stretching to the left / There's hunger in my eyes, but the truth is on my chest / I am just a man who wants revenge, and I confess / I am full of rage and sin / Locked inside this cage again / When evil reigns 'cause people like to win / It may seem sweet, but we won't like the end / So we shine brightly from the light within / You're opening the doors to the corridors stretching to the left / Anger within my eyes, but the truth is on my chest / I am just a man who wants revenge and I confess / I am full of rage and sin / Locked inside this cage again / Where evil reigns and people like to win / It may seem sweet, but we won't like the end / So we shine brightly from the light within / Locked inside this cage again / Locked inside this cage again / Locked inside this cage again / Locked inside this cage again / Turn the music up a bit... / Yo, yo... / Dark secrets, demons with a conscience / I'm the Lone Ranger looking for Pocahontas / Teenage zombies flying the beat / I'm dying to learn what I'm trying to be / Go Bad News Bears and the Dukes of Hazzard / The youth of my group is the truth, so have it / Keep myself couped up, recoup quickly / Face still hurts but my kids stick with me / Death loved not far as we go / Crazy face, still not star of the show / I appreciate the chance truth hurts, I'll kill you / Ice pick into your neck, I will do (Anything) / Talk to you like I might care (Anything) / Rippled by the nightmare, moonshine distillery / Back road to villiany / Military star, I depart with artillery / With artillery / With artillery / With artillery / With artillery / With artillery / With artillery / With artillery / With artillery / With artillery / With artillery / With artillery / With artillery / With artillery / With artillery / With ta ra ta ta ta ta... / Locked inside this cage again / Locked inside this cage again / Locked inside this cage again / Locked inside this cage again / _______________ / Name Artillery / Artist Infected Mushroom / Album Vicious Delicious"/>
