I know what it takes to break you
You know I never sleep

Just because you made them think
Doesn't mean the world will fall into place

Took some time but now you know
Tomorrow is too late

Close your eyes
Walk with me
I set you free
And everything you ask for

I found the way and I'll return here soon
I have to see those who don't know
Rest in peace, I'm coming for you
And I will be, I will be with you tonight

If today was your last day
Would that change a thing?

You probably believe what you told them
Live each moment like your last
Close your eyes, walk with me, I set you free
And everything you ask for

I found the way and I'll return here soon
I have to see those who don't know
Rest in peace, I'm coming for you
And I will be, I will be with you tonight
