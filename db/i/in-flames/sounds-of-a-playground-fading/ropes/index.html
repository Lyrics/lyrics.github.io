<title>In Flames â€“ Ropes | Lyrics</title>
<meta name="description" content="How much can we take before we care to settle? / Thought we were set for a perfect scene / Everyone is waiting for a failure / Something I can please and justify / The void within our lives / Everyone is waiting for something they cannot have / Why don't you drop your guard / I'm on my knees / You got the mindset of a killer / And it will not take you far / If I had the answer would that make you stay? / This is the time and place it is your moment of fate / If this would be your last breath / Would it change a thing? / Dive head first into the fire / If you just let me I'll find a way / To ease your mind and for you to stay / And I will untie all the ropes / It's hard for me but believe me, I'm trying / What are you longing for? / What are you longing for? / What are you longing for? / If I had the answer / Would that make you stay / This is the time and place / You are waiting for something you cannot have / If this would be your last breath / Would it change a thing? / Dive head first into the fire / If you just let me I'll find a way / To ease your mind and for you to stay / And I will untie all the ropes / It's hard for me / If you just let me I'll find a way / To ease your mind and for you to stay / And I will untie all the ropes / It's hard for me, believe me, I'm trying / ___________ / Name Ropes / Artist In Flames / Album Sounds Of A Playground Fading"/>
