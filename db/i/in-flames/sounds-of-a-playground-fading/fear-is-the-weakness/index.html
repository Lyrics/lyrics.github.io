<title>In Flames â€“ Fear Is The Weakness | Lyrics</title>
<meta name="description" content="At least you could have tried / It is way past time and we're scattering ashes / You take everything in sight, please hear me now / You, you are leaving me with scars / Fear is the weakness in all of us / It's sad to see you go / It's not meant to be easy but you drag us down / Burden of the evidence grows / The same road for far too long / It's not meant to be / We're losing identity / Faith has been denied let's not pretend / This is the first time we just don't belong / What world do you perceive? / All turn cold, no one cares for anyone / Waiting for a final blow / Do you have strength at all? / One more day then we fade away / Fear is the weakness in all of us / It's sad to see you go / It's not meant to be easy but you drag us down / Burden of the evidence grows / The same road for far too long / It's not meant to be / We're losing identity / Faith has been denied let's not pretend / This is the first time we just don't belong / The same road for far too long / It's not meant to be / We're losing identity / Faith has been denied let's not pretend / This is the first time we just don't belong / __________________________ / Name Fear Is The Weakness / Artist In Flames / Album Sounds Of A Playground Fading"/>
