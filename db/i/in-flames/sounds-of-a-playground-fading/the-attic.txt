There is someone in the attic
Building a strange machine
Never really seen him
But I think he works all day

Blinded by the world outside
I stay inside
Hardly know my name
But it's getting better by time

I saw something in the mirror
Someone's watching me
If I hide in the attic
He will never get to me

I found some rope on the floor
I have to build a trap
So I started on my machine
I'm never to be seen
