Big picture slowly fades
Walls are closing in
And there I was cursing the ground
Unable to understand

I won't let the world break me
So I need to change direction
Nothing special and far from perfect
Light the way for me

Feel I was running an endless mile
Last candle burns and I'm dying inside
All of this will turn to ash
A change for a peace of mind

Walking where the dead ships dwell
These are shores I left behind
Streets were getting smaller and I had to leave

Feel I was running an endless mile
Last candle burns and I'm dying inside
All of this will turn to ash
A change for a peace of mind

All I hear is noise
Hearts of false hope
Guess I took it all for granted
I know I went too far
I won't say I'm sorry
I got what I deserved
I got what I deserved

Feel I was running an endless mile
Last candle burns and I'm dying inside
All of this will turn to ash
A change for a peace of mind

Feel I was running an endless mile
Last candle burns and I'm dying inside
All of this will turn to ash
A change for a peace of mind
