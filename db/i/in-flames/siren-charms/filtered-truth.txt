We're all in this together
Or so I was told
All for one, one for none

When it's time
You know this could never be justified
But still you take the hatred home

Or is this what you were searching for?
The wounded and its filtered truth
Don't ignore a life that's real

How come you feel so alone?
Is it the rage inside
Wipes it all away?
The rage inside

You're battered against the world, you knew
A place to hide from everything
And it had to make you fall

How come you feel so alone?
Is it the rage inside
Wipes it all away?
The rage inside

How come you feel so alone?
Is it the rage inside
Wipes it all away?
The rage inside

How come you feel so alone?
Is it the rage inside
Wipes it all away?
The rage inside
