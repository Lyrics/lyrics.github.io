A fate that we deserve
There's no escape
We're walking backwards
I'm on your side
But life's a selfish thing
Like broken promises

A thousand times
Try to fake it
Just another liar

It's the wall that we are building
All the things that we made wrong
Don't hate yourself if you walk away
You reach, but nothing's there
Time and time again
Colors fade from black to grey

How come we walk a mile
Just to shatter what we love?
Eyes wide open
Reflections of an unfamiliar face
Saying - You know you are heading -

The lost dream
Of what could have been
It makes no difference

It's the wall that we are building
All the things that we made wrong
Don't hate yourself if you walk away
You reach, but nothing's there
Time and time again
Colors fade from black to grey

It's the wall that we are building
All the things that we made wrong
Don't hate yourself if you walk away
You reach, but nothing's there
Time and time again
Colors fade from black to grey
