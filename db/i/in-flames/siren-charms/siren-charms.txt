How far until the edge?
These wrong ways are mine
But the whole world can just go to hell
This life is killing me
My feelings inside I can't explain
I'm awake, but not for long

The hope is still not gone
Somewhere behind the clouds
I'll set you free if you follow me
Reach out touch the hand of God

I gave you the story of my life
Some of my precious time
But I'm tired of this
With every promise of eternal light
Another feeling dies

The hope is still not gone
Somewhere behind the clouds
I'll set you free if you follow me
Reach out touch the hand of God

The hope is still not gone
Somewhere behind the clouds
I'll set you free if you follow me
Reach out touch the hand of God

I'll set you free if you follow me
Reach out touch the hand of God
