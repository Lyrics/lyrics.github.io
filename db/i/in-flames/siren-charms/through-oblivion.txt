False affection took the best of me
Deep inside, the absent mind
Denial and hypocrisy
All this the same
To do this we part our ways

My destination, my mission, my intuition
so close I feel it changing me
Suddenly I know, I have to let it go

All that's been lost, all that's been won
Now I feel right before me
Intentions are pure, I'm out of reach

My destination, my mission, my intuition
So close I feel it changing me
I might dare to believe
And I have wings (I have)
Nothing and everything at the same time
Oh, a brighter sun

Save me from my fears
And darkest thought of her
Carry me through times
Through oblivion

My destination, my mission, my intuition
So close I feel it changing me
I might dare to believe

My destination, my mission, my intuition
So close I feel it changing me
I might dare to believe, cause now I know!
