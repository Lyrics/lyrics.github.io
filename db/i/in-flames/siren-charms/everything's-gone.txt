Where I have nothing
Fearless and whole
Find out what you are
Back in time

No
I won't
I need this
Truth is...

Once you had enough
Break out
Room to breathe
To love
Before you're gone

I'm the one
Who brought the mountain down
Tore it piece by piece... Down
Everything's gone

Where I have nothing
There's no hate
Room to breathe
No envy and nothing to lose

I'm the one
Who brought the mountain down
Tore it piece by piece... Down
Everything's gone

Once you had enough
Break out

I'm the one
Who brought the mountain down
Tore it piece by piece... Down
