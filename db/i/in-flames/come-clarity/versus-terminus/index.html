<title>In Flames â€“ Versus Terminus | Lyrics</title>
<meta name="description" content="When all is said and done / We know what's right, what's wrong / But does it matter then / When all is said and done? / When all is said and done / We know who who lost who won / But does it matter then / When all is dead and gone? / Seeing everything go / End of all things / And life as we know it / Shift your point of view / You've been warned / This one way ticket is for you / When all the lights go out / We know what that's about / But does it matter then / When all the lights go out? / When all that's left is lies / There'll be nothing / Left to realize / But does it matter do / They know they left its lies / Seeing everything go / End of all things / And life as we know it / Shift your point of view / You've been warned / This one way ticket is for you / When all that's left is lies / We'll see nothing / Left to realize / But does it matter do / They know they left its lies / Seeing everything go / End of all things / The life, that we know / Shift your point of view / You've been warned / This one way ticket is for you / _____________________ / Name Versus Terminus / Artist In Flames / Album Come Clarity"/>
