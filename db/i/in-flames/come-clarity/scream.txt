We are ordinary people
We all exist with life
In the end we pray
Don't let them see
We're just living different lies
We're just living different lies
We're just living different lies

I say scream, you scream
I scream, we scream
But no one listens
Abuse to feel superior
Is it working for you
They scream, you scream
I scream, we scream
Abuse to feel superior
Is it working for you?

We're ordinary people
Mortal realms?

Say scream, you scream
I scream, we scream
But no one listens
Abuse to feel superior
Is it working for you
They scream, you scream
I scream, we scream
Abuse to feel superior
Is it working for you?

We're just living different lies
We're just living different lies

I say scream, you scream
I scream, we scream
But no one listens
Abuse to feel superior
Is it working for you
They scream, you scream
I scream, we scream
Abuse to feel superior
Is it working for you?
