Find time
And play with innocence
Like you ever would
I don't see you make any sense
I guess you deliver misery
Just like you should

9 o'clock
And you paint the skies grey
It's not your fault
We're the ones who betray
But how can you say it with such ease?
You want to take a stand or just please?

Your bedtime story is scaring everyone
But you make me understand the evil that men do
The evil that men do
