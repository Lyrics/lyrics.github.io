<title>Perturbator â€“ Hard Wired (feat. Memory Ghost's Isabella Goloversic) | Lyrics</title>
<meta name="description" content="You can hang on to me if you don't know / I'll take you down the line / Don't you move too fast but don't go too slow / I want your love tonight / You can hang on to me if you don't know / And we'll go down the line / Don't you move too fast but don't go too slow / I need your love tonight / I'll catch you when you fall and fall again / You catch me when I fall / I fall again / I'll catch when you're falling / Fall again / You can hang on to me if you don't know / I'll take you down the line / Don't you move too fast but don't go too slow / I want your love tonight / You can hang on to me if you don't know / And we'll go down the line / Don't you move too fast but don't go too slow / I need your love tonight / He goes/I go / He knows/I know / He goes/I go / He knows/I know / He goes/I go / He knows/I know / He goes/I go / He knows, it's only a matter of time / Do you know what I need now? / (hold on and let it go) / (you can hang on to me if you don't know) / Well, you're all that I need right now / (I'll catch your fall) / (you can hang on to me if you don't know) / And you know what I need now / (hold on and let it go) / (you can hang on to me if you don't know) / Oh, you're all that I need right now / So fall / ________________ / Name Hard Wired / Artist Perturbator, Isabella Goloversic / Album Dangerous Days / Original text by Isabella Goloversic"/>
