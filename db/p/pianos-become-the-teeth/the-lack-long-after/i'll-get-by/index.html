    <div class="view"><article id="lyrics"><p>I used to listen to my life,<br/> I was so put together,<br/> I chose what I wanted to be in that age of chasing sand,<br/> The age of believing in everything,<br/> But I couldn't save you,<br/> I couldn't save what was taken away,<br/> And I'm still singing, and you still can't stay.<br/> You "loved life," and those words have lasted,<br/> I just wish I would have had ears for more than what you said<br/> Because I still feel the lack long after.<br/> Such a light body, such a quiet gait leaving behind the weight of the world,<br/> I'll always think it was too early to lose your shine,<br/> I guess the means that ends us means nothing,<br/> I just hope it's the peace we all need,<br/> Because I could love and drown in your God damned smile lines,<br/> But I think I burnt up watching you rallying to stay alive,<br/> And I guess that's fine.<br/> It seems we all get sick,<br/> We all die in some no name hospital with the same colored walls,<br/> And I guess that's fine,<br/> But I want to swallow, I want to stomach, I want to live.<br/> It's been a rough while and some days are worse than others,<br/> There's no proper way to feel, no mirth, no levity, no amazing grace,<br/> Just a flame on a lake floating away,<br/> I can't let you lay,<br/> I want you to know, I'm learning patience against my will,<br/> I want you to know, I'll get by, always barely scraping<br/> With just a hunger, with just a heart apart,<br/> It's a hell of a thing.</p></article></div>
