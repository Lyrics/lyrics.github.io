    <div class="view"><article id="lyrics"><p>Maybe...; Maybe you saw your mother, maybe she's smiling,<br/>She hears your catching laughter, she's missed your charm,<br/>We never made it to Cooperstown<br/>But I've still got that glove under my bed,<br/>Maybe I'll see you, we could shoot the shit, finally have a beer,<br/>"Have a catch,"but for now its catch my tears, its catch my breath,<br/>I can just hear you say "come on bud, get out of that funk, it's time to move on,"<br/>It's funny how you still apply, you still know me,<br/>I'll try to take your tools and make something worth while,<br/>Try to make ya proud, I've learned nothing is spotless anymore,<br/>But I'll let you resonate...;</p><p>Maybe your Heaven is that Norman Rockwell scene<br/>Where you and your friends are singing that Gordon Lightfoot song,<br/>"If you could only read my mind," well if you could only read my mind,<br/>Well that ending, it was just too hard to take,<br/>Is it better than Clapton? Did you see your fathers eyes?<br/>I know it's wishful thinking hoping this won't always kill me,<br/>But If you saw yours, then I'll see mine,<br/>You finally stretched your feet and ghosted away from me,<br/>You had to fade away, you had to leave<br/>I'm pleading for one more time with what I know now,<br/>I'm begging for the same flake to fall twice for the first time,<br/>I'm begging for what wasn't said.<br/>That night the snow shaped the land, and I walked home,<br/>I laughed the whole way because I suppose if it hurts,<br/>It's worth it, but now that ghost is me.</p></article></div>
