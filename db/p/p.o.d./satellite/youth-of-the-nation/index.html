<title>P.O.D. â€“ Youth Of The Nation | Lyrics</title>
<meta name="description" content="Last day of the rest of my life / I wish I would've known / Cause I would've kissed my mama goodbye / I didn't tell her that I loved her and how much I care / Or thank my pops for all the talks / And all the wisdom he shared / Unaware, I just did what I always do / Everyday, the same routine / Before I skate off to school / But who knew that this day wasn't like the rest / Instead of taking a test / I took two to the chest / Call me blind, but I didn't see it coming / Everybody was running / But I couldn't hear nothing / Except gun blasts, it happened so fast / I didn't really know this kid / He wasn't part of the class / Maybe this kid was reaching out for love / Or maybe for a moment / He forgot who he was / Or maybe this kid just wanted to be hugged / Whatever it was / I know it's because / We are, we are, the youth of the nation / We are, we are, youth of the nation / We are, we are, the youth of the nation / We are, we are, youth of the nation / Little Suzy, she was only twelve / She was given the world / With every chance to excel / Hang with the boys and hear the stories they tell / She might act kind of proud / But no respect for herself / She finds love in all the wrong places / The same situations / Just different faces / Changed up her pace since her daddy left her / Too bad he never told her / She deserved much better / Johnny boy always played the fool / He broke all the rules / So you would think he was cool / He was never really one of the guys / No matter how hard he tried / Often thought of suicide / It's kind of hard when you ain't got no friends / He put his life to an end / They might remember him then / You cross the line and there's no turning back / Told the world how he felt / With the sound of a gat / We are, we are, the youth of the nation / We are, we are, youth of the nation / We are, we are, the youth of the nation / We are, we are, youth of the nation / Who's to blame for the lives that tragedies claim / No matter what you say / It don't take away the pain / That I feel inside, I'm tired of all the lies / Don't nobody know why / It's the blind leading the blind / I guess that's the way the story goes / Will it ever make sense / Somebody's got to know / There's got to be more to life than this / There's got to be more to everything / I thought exists / We are, we are, the youth of the nation / We are, we are, youth of the nation / We are, we are, (we are, we are) the youth of the nation / We are, we are, (we are, we are) youth of the nation / We are, we are, (we are, we are) the youth of the nation (the youth of nation) / We are, we are, (we are, we are) youth of the nation (youth of the nation) / We are, we are, (we are, we are) the youth of the nation (the youth of nation) / We are, we are, (we are, we are) youth of the nation (youth of the nation) / (We are) Youth of the nation / (We are) Youth of the nation / (We are) Youth of the nation / (We are...) / _________________________ / Name Youth Of The Nation / Artist P.O.D. / Album Satellite"/>
