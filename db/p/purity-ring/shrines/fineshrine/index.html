<title>Purity Ring â€“ Fineshrine | Lyrics</title>
<meta name="description" content="Get a little closer, let fold / Cut open my sternum and pull / My little ribs around you / The rungs of me be under, under you / I'll take the South pockets gladly / Over the rocky cliffs that you leap / To peer over and not forget what feet are / Splitting threads of thunder over me / But I might see with my chest and sink / Into the edges round you / Into the lakes and quarries that brink / On all the edges round you, round you, round you / Get a little closer, let fold / Cut open my sternum and pull / My little ribs around you / Through arms that may be crowns over you / Get a little closer, let fold / Cut open my sternum and pull / My little ribs around you / Though arms that may be under, under you / I'll take the South pockets likely / Over the rocky cliffs that you leap / To peer over and not forget what feet are / Splitting threads of thunder over me / Listen closely, closely to the floor / Emitting all its graces through the pores / You make a fine shrine in me / You'll build a fine shrine in me / But I must see with my chest and sink / Into the edges round you / Into the lakes and quarries that brink / On all the edges round you, round you, round you / Get a little closer, let fold / Cut open my sternum and pull / My little ribs around you / Through arms that may be crowns over you / Get a little closer, let fold / Cut open my sternum and pull / My little ribs around you / Through arms that may be under, under you / ________________ / Name Fineshrine / Artist Purity Ring / Album Shrines"/>
