<title>Panic! At The Disco â€“ That Green Gentleman (Things Have Changed) | Lyrics</title>
<meta name="description" content="Things are shaping up to be pretty odd / Little deaths in musical beds / So it seems I'm someone I've never met / You will only hear these elegant crimes / Fall on your ears from criminal dimes / They spill unfound from a pretty mouth / And everybody gets their, everybody gets their / And everybody gets their way / I never said I missed her when everybody kissed her / Now I'm the only one to blame / Things have changed for me, and that's okay / I feel the same, I'm on my way, and I say / Things have changed for me, and that's okay / I want to go where everyone goes / I want to know what everyone knows / I want to go where everyone feels the same / I never said I'd leave the city / I never said I'd leave this town / A falling out we won't tiptoe about / And everybody gets their, everybody gets their / And everybody gets their way / I never said I missed her when everybody kissed her / Well, I'm the only one to blame / Things have changed for me, and that's okay / I feel the same, I'm on my way, and I say / Things have changed for me, and that's okay / I feel the same, and I say / Things have changed for me, and that's okay / I feel the same, and I say / Things have changed for me, and that's okay / I feel the same, and I say / Things have changed for me, and that's okay / I'm on my way, and I say / Things have changed for me / ________________________________________________ / Name That Green Gentleman (Things Have Changed) / Artist Panic! At The Disco / Album Pretty. Odd."/>
