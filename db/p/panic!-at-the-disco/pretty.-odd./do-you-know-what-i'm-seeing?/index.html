<title>Panic! At The Disco â€“ Do You Know What I'm Seeing? | Lyrics</title>
<meta name="description" content="Clouds are marching along, singing a song, just like they do / If the clouds were singing a song, I'd sing along, wouldn't you too? / If you just knew what they could do / Oh, if you just knew, what would they do? / And if the birds are just all the words flying along, singing a song / What would they do? / If they just knew what they could do / Oh, if they just knew / I know it's sad that I never gave a damn about the weather / And it never gave a damn about me / I know it's sad that I never gave a damn about the weather / And it never gave a damn about me / No, it never gave a damn about me / I know it's mad, but if I go to hell / Will you come with me or just leave? / I know it's mad, but if the world were ending / Would you kiss me or just leave me? / Just leave me? / Clouds are singing a song, marching along, just like they do / If the clouds were playing a song, I'd play along, wouldn't you too? / If you just knew what they could do / Oh, if you just knew, what would they do? / And if words are just hollow birds, flying along, singing a song / What would they do? / If they just knew what we could do / Oh, if they just knew / I know it's sad that I never gave a damn about the weather / And it never gave a damn about me / I know it's sad that I never gave a damn about the weather / And it never gave a damn about me / No, it never gave a damn about me / I know it's mad, but if I go to hell / Will you come with me or just leave? / I know it's mad, but if the world were ending / Would you kiss me or just leave me? / Just leave me? / I know it's sad that I never gave a damn about the weather / And it never gave a damn about me / I know it's sad that I never gave a damn about the weather / And it never gave a damn about me / I know it's sad that I never gave a damn about the weather / And it never gave a damn about me / I know it's sad that I never gave a damn about the weather / And it never gave a damn about me / No, it never gave a damn about me / __________________________________ / Name Do You Know What I'm Seeing? / Artist Panic! At The Disco / Album Pretty. Odd."/>
