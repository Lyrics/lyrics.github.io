<title>Panic! At The Disco â€“ Time To Dance | Lyrics</title>
<meta name="description" content="Well, she's not bleeding on the ballroom floor / Just for the attention / Because that's just ridiculously odd / Well, she sure is going to get it / Here's the setting / Fashion magazines line the walls now / The walls line the bullet holes / Have some composure / Where is your posture? / Oh, no, no / You're pulling the trigger / Pulling the trigger / All wrong / Have some composure / Where is your posture? / Oh, no, no / You're pulling the trigger / Pulling the trigger / All wrong / Give me envy, give me malice, give me your attention / Give me envy, give me malice, baby, give me a break / When I say "Shotgun," you say "Wedding" / "Shotgun," "Wedding," "Shotgun," "Wedding" / She didn't choose this role / But she'll play it and make it sincere / So you cry, you cry / (Give me a break) / But they believe it from the tears / And the teeth right down to the blood / At her feet / Boys will be boys / Hiding in estrogen and wearing Aubergine Dreams / (Give me a break) / Have some composure / Where is your posture? / Oh, no, no / You're pulling the trigger / Pulling the trigger / All wrong / Come on this is screaming "photo op" / Come on, come on / This is screaming, this is screaming / This is screaming "photo op" / Boys will be boys, baby / Boys will be boys / Boys will be boys, baby / Boys will be boys / Give me envy, give me malice, give me your attention / Give me envy, give me malice, baby, give me a break / When I say "Shotgun," you say "Wedding" / "Shotgun," "Wedding," "Shotgun," "Wedding" / Boys will be boys / Hiding in estrogen and boys will be boys / Boys will be boys / Hiding in estrogen and wearing Aubergine Dreams / ___________________ / Name Time To Dance / Artist Panic! At The Disco / Album A Fever You Can't Sweat Out"/>
