<title>Panic! At The Disco â€“ London Beckoned Songs About Money Written By Machines | Lyrics</title>
<meta name="description" content="Stop stalling, make a name for yourself / Boy you better put that pen to paper, charm your way out / If you talk you better walk you better back your shit up / With more than good hooks while you're all under the gun / Start talking "a sensationalist" / Oh he's slightly clever to just a certain extent / If you talk you better walk you better keep your mouth shut / With more than good hooks while you're all under the gun / (Panic!: meet the press) / It's time for us to take a chance / It's time for us to take a chance / (Panic!: meet the press) / It's time for us to take a chance / It's time for us... / Well we're just a wet dream for the webzine, / Make us it, make us hip, make us scene / Or shrug us off your shoulders / Don't approve a single word that we wrote / Well we're just a wet dream for the webzine, / Make us it, make us hip, make us scene / Or shrug us off your shoulders / Don't approve a single word that we wrote / I'm burning and I'm blacking my lungs / Boy you know it feels good with fire back on your tongue / If you talk you better walk you better back your shit up / With more than good hooks while you're all under the gun / Start talking "a sensationalist" / Oh he's slightly clever to just a certain extent / Well keep quiet let us sing like the doves / Then decide if it's done with purpose or lack thereof / Just for the record, / The weather today is slightly sarcastic with a good chance of: / A. Indifference or / B. Disinterest in what the critics say / It's time for us to take a chance / It's time for us... / Well we're just a wet dream for the webzine, / Make us it, make us hip, make us scene / Or shrug us off your shoulders / Don't approve a single word that we wrote / Well we're just a wet dream for the webzine, / Make us it, make us hip, make us scene / Or shrug us off your shoulders / Don't approve a single word that we wrote / Just for the record, / The weather today is slightly sarcastic with a good chance of: / A. Indifference or / B. Disinterest in what the critics say / Well we're just a wet dream for the webzine, / Make us it, make us hip, make us scene / Or shrug us off your shoulders / Don't approve a single word that we wrote / Well we're just a wet dream for the webzine, / Make us it, make us hip, make us scene / Or shrug us off your shoulders / Don't approve a single word that we wrote / Just for the record, / The weather today is slightly sarcastic with a good chance of: / A.
