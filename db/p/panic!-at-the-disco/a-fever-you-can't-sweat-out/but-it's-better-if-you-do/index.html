<title>Panic! At The Disco – But It's Better If You Do | Lyrics</title>
<meta name="description" content="Now I'm of consenting age / To be forgetting you in a cabaret / Somewhere downtown where a burlesque queen / May even ask my name / As she sheds her skin on stage / I'm seated and sweating to a dance song on the club's PA / The strip joint veteran sits two away / Smirking between dignified sips of his dignified / Peach and lime daiquiri / Isn't this exactly where you'd like me? / I'm exactly where you'd like me, you know / Praying for love in a lap dance / And paying in naïveté / Oh, isn't this exactly where you'd like me? / I'm exactly where you'd like me, you know / Praying for love in a lap dance / And paying in naïveté / Oh, but I'm afraid that I / Well I may have faked it / And I wouldn't be caught dead, d-dead, d-dead, d-dead in this place / Well I'm afraid that I / Well that's right, well I may have faked it / And I wouldn't be caught dead in this place / Isn't this exactly where you'd like me? / I'm exactly where you'd like me, you know / Praying for love in a lap dance / And paying in naïveté / Oh, isn't this exactly where you'd like me? / I'm exactly where you'd like me, you know / Praying for love in a lap dance / And paying in naïveté / Well I'm afraid that I / Well I may have faked it / And I wouldn't be caught dead, d-dead, d-dead, d-dead in this place / Well I'm afraid that I / Well that's right, well I may have faked it / And I wouldn't be caught dead in this place / Isn't this exactly where you'd like me? / I'm exactly where you'd like me, you know / Praying for love in a lap dance / And paying in naïveté / Oh, isn't this exactly where you'd like me? / I'm exactly where you'd like me, you know / Praying for love in a lap dance / And paying in naïveté / Praying for love and paying in naïveté / Praying for love and paying in naïveté, oh / _______________________________ / Name But It's Better If You Do / Artist Panic!
