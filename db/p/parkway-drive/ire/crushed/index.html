<title>Parkway Drive â€“ Crushed | Lyrics</title>
<meta name="description" content="Brothers, my brothers / Is this all that we are / Sisters, my sisters / We've been crushed by the fists of god / Welcome to the free world / Where nothing's as it seems / Tell me, can you find a cure / When you can't see, and you can't feel the disease / Can you seek a higher truth / When you're living on your knees / Where freedom grows from blood soaked soil / In the lands of hypocrisy / Because if you can't see the chains tell me what use is a key / It's cash, blood and oil, in the age of the refugee / They're trying to buy our minds, we ain't selling / Bang, bang, bang, hear they're nailing down the coffins / Cut the strings, feel your heart start / Cut the cord, crack this code of silence / All our lives in the hands of tyrants / Crushed by the fists of god, crushed / We've been crushed by the fists of god / To the left I see the rats and to the right I see the snakes / In my ear they're whispering sweet sermons of cruel hate / So do you buy the fear, or do you buy the lies / Tell me, what will set us free / Do we kneel before the crooked few / Or do we bite the fucking hand that feeds / When death casts no shadow and hope carries no weight / Rise into the light and feel the shackles fade away / They fear what we know, We know how they break / Bang, bang, bang, drop the hammer of conscience / Cut the strings, feel your heart start / Cut the cord, crack this code of silence, all our lives / Crushed by the fists of god, crushed / We've been crushed by the fists of god / We're just waiting for the sky to fall / Yeah I'm just waiting / Feels like all our lives we've been waiting for the sky to fall / Feels like all this time we've been / Brothers, my brothers / Is this all that we are / Sisters, my sisters / We've been / Crushed by the fists of god / Crushed by the fists of god, crushed / _____________ / Name Crushed / Artist Parkway Drive / Album Ire"/>
