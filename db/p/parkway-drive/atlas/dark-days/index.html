<title>Parkway Drive â€“ Dark Days | Lyrics</title>
<meta name="description" content="What will you tell your children when they ask you: / "What went wrong?" / How can you paint a picture of a paradise lost / To eyes that know only a wasteland? / How will you justify? / Justify - watching the world die? / The clock is ticking, can't you feel our days are numbered / Head first into disaster from which there will be no return / With narrow minds, we decimate our one true home / Cast into oblivion, judgment is calling. / Behold the pale horse / This is the funeral of the Earth / Behold the pale horse / This is the funeral. / The blind eye can no longer be cast / The clock is ticking, there is no second chance. / The blind eye can no longer be cast / There will be no future if we can't learn from our mistakes / The clock is ticking, there is no second chance / There will be no future if we can't learn. / A forced extinction closes out the age of apathy / The final act - sacrifice the world's ecology / The death of beauty, the death of hope / Cast before the throne of avarice, judgment is calling. / Behold the pale horse / This is the funeral of the Earth / Behold the pale horse / This is the funeral. / The blind eye can no longer be cast / There will be no future if we can't learn from our mistakes / The clock is ticking, there is no second chance / There will be no future, if we can't learn. / I can't watch it burn! / I can't watch it burn! / I can't watch it burn! / I can't watch it burn! / I can't watch it burn! / I can't watch it burn! / I can't watch it burn! / Behold the pale horse! / _______________ / Name Dark Days / Artist Parkway Drive / Album Atlas"/>
