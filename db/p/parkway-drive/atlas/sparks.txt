Born of dust and stone
Dead hearts, roaming a dying home
Life leaves us all
White bones upon the shores of time
We are but sparks in a darkened world
And yet some things were born to burn.

The napalm in your eyes
Is all my cold heart needs
If you bring the matches...
I'll bring the gasoline!

I'm the same bad news as you
You're the same kind of "fucked" as me
I'm the same bad news as you
You're the same, you're the same as me!
