Well, it's been such a long time coming; I thought you'd understand
That I'm so far ahead of the lines you've been drowning in the sand
But it's simple; you were wrong
You must have known that we didn't belong

I know you thought I'd sold my soul, but you never told me to my face
I just had to leave you cold, and blow this shit away

Here we go again-gain-gain...
