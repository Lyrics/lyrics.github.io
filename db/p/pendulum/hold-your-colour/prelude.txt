Somewhere out there in the vast nothingness of space
Somewhere far away in space and time
Staring upward at the gleaming stars in the obsidian sky
We're marooned on a small island, in an endless sea
Confined to a tiny spit of sand, unable to escape
But tonight, on this small planet, on Earth
We're going to rock civilization
