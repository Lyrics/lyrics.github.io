<title>Pendulum â€“ The Fountain (feat. Steven Wilson) | Lyrics</title>
<meta name="description" content="You sure you're right? Well no; you're wrong / You don't feel my energy, but it won't be long / I see the sun; believe the dark / Soon I disappear, but I'll make my mark / All these fears, and all this love / All you've given me, but it's not enough / All my dreams, and all this stuff / All made real, but it's not enough / Watching, waiting, shaping, faking / Shocking, pumping, mocking, stopping / Falling, stalling, warning, crawling / Rejecting, perfecting, marauding, ending / Behind my eyes is rage alone / But you don't understand; it was all homegrown / I'm not afraid; I just don't belong / It may be cynical, but it all seems wrong / All these fears, and all this love / All you've given me, but it's not enough / All my dreams, and all this stuff / All made real, but it's not enough / Watching, waiting, shaping, faking / Shocking, pumping, mocking, stopping / Falling, stalling, warning, crawling / Rejecting, perfecting, marauding, ending / Behind my eyes is rage alone / But you don't understand; it was all homegrown / I'm not afraid; I just don't belong / It may be cynical, but it all seems wrong / All these fears, and all this love / All you've given me, but it's not enough / All my dreams, and all this stuff / All made real, but it's not enough / Watching, waiting, shaping, faking / Shocking, pumping, mocking, stopping / Falling, stalling, warning, crawling / Rejecting, perfecting, marauding, ending / ________________________________________ / Name The Fountain (feat. Steven Wilson) / Artist Pendulum / Album Immersion"/>
