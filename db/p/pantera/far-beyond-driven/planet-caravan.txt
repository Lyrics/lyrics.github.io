We sail through endless skies
Stars shine like eyes
The black night sighs

The Moon in silver trees
Falls down in tears
Light of the night

The Earth, a purple blaze
Of sapphire haze
In orbit always

While down below the trees
Bathed in cool breeze
Silver starlight
Breaks down the night

And so we pass on by
The crimson eye
Of great god Mars
As we travel the Universe
