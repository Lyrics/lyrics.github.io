<title>Underwater Pilots â€“ Loud and Clear | Lyrics</title>
<meta name="description" content="(Coming in loud and clear / I can feel that you are here / You are coming in / Loud and clear) / No one has seen me / No one has reached me / 'Cause the way is just too long / I have a thousand names / And I know many tricks / To dissapear when you get too close / You wanna find me / But you can't blind me / I will tell you something / You already know / Don't be disappointed / If your mission fails this time / Coming in loud and clear / I can feel that you are here / You are coming in / Loud and clear / Coming in loud and clear / I can feel that you are here / You are coming in / Loud and clear / It's time for me to start / I have to reach the other shore / Before the day will rise / I have to choose a single name / Leave the past behind and change the facts / If I won't start now, I will never do / I walk on frozen ground / My feet are losing contact / It is uncertain / I hope I will arrive / I'm going on into your direction / Coming in loud and clear / I can feel that you are here / You are coming in / Loud and clear / Coming in loud and clear / I can feel that you are here / You are coming in / Loud and clear / Coming in loud and clear / I can feel that you are here / You are coming in / Loud and clear / Coming in loud and clear / I can feel that you are here / You are coming in / Loud and clear / (Coming in loud and clear / I can feel that you are here / You are coming in / Loud and clear) / Coming in loud and clear / I can feel that you are here / You are coming in / Loud and clear / ____________________ / Name Loud and Clear / Artist Underwater Pilots / Album Tranquil Places"/>
