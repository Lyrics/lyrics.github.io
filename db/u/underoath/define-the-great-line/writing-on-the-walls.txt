Maybe we, why don't we
Sit right here for half an hour?
We'll speak of what a waste I am
And how we missed your beat again

I swear we need to find some comfort
In this run-down place
To bridge the gap of this
Concious state that we live in
And I'm short on time

How come you try to place us all
To fit the shape of
And I break what they tell you
You to move on
But mostly what they show you (Move on)

At this rate, we can't give up
I'm takin' back all the things I've said
I'm takin' back all the things I've said
But I sure can't just sit still
Keep me filled in and I swear I'll come

We walk alone, we walk alone
We walk alone, we walk alone
We walk alone, we walk alone
Back home alone
Back home

You're almost gone and I'm okay
I still see your shadow
To give you time to be afraid
But never your face
Again I remember
Your presence

I hope to God you come down
I hope to God you feel this now
I hope to God you come down
I hope to God

I know there must be some way out of here
And all of them will be waiting there
