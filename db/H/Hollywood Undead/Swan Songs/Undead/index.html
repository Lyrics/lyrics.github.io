Undead, Undead

Deuce: You better get up out the way
Tomorrow we'll rise, so let's fight today
You know I don't give a fuck what you think and say
'Cause we gon' rock this whole place anyway

Undead, you better get up out the way
Tomorrow we'll rise, so let's fight today
You know I don't give a fuck what you think and say
'Cause we gon' rock this whole place anyway

Johnny 3 Tears: Look up and see that motherfuckin' writing on the wall
When you see J3T 30 deep, he's down to brawl
Fuck all haters I see 'cause I hate that you breathe
I see you duck, you little punk, you little fuckin' disease
I got HU tatted on the front of my arms
Boulevard brass knuckles in the back of the car
'Cause we drunk drive Cadillacs, we never go far
But when you see us motherfuckers, better know who we are

I got one thing to say to punk asses who hate
Motherfuckers don't know but you better watch what you say
From these industry fucks to these faggot-ass punks
You don't know what it takes to get this motherfucking drunk
I'm already ridin' baby, it's a little too late
Johnny's takin' heads off of all faggots who hate
'Cause I'm like God, motherfucker, there's a price to pay
Yeah, I'm a God, motherfucker and it's Judgement Day

Deuce: Undead, you better get up out the way
Tomorrow we'll rise, so let's fight today
You know I don't give a fuck what you think and say
'Cause we gon' rock this whole place anyway

Undead, you better get up out the way
Tomorrow we'll rise, so let's fight today
You know I don't give a fuck what you think and say
'Cause we gon' rock this whole place anyway

(Da Kurlzz: Charlie Scene!)
Charlie Scene: I'm getting used to this nuisance of fags who bad mouth this music
How fuckin' stupid and foolish of you to think you can do this?
You cowards can't, you never will, don't even try to pursue it
I took the chance, I paid the bill, I nearly died for this music
You make me wanna run around pullin' my guns out and shit
You're temptin' me to run my mouth and call you out on this
(Charlie Scene and Da Kurlzz: Bitch!)
How ignorant you gotta be to believe any of this?
You need to slit your wrist, get pissed and go jump off a bridge

What you can't see the sarcasm in the verses I spit?
What you think I just got lucky and didn't work for this shit?
Bitch, I've been working at this ever since I was a kid
I've played a million empty shows for only family and friends
What kind of person would diss a band that deserves to get big?
I'd hate to be that person when my verse comes out their kids lips
That shit's as worse as it gets, this verse is over, I quit
Signed "Charlie Scene" on your girlfriend's tits

Deuce: Undead, you better get up out the way
Tomorrow we'll ridse, so let's fight today
You know I don't give a fuck what you think and say
'Cause we gon' rock this whole place anyway

Undead, you better get up out the way
Tomorrow we'll rise, so let's fight today
You know I don't give a fuck what you think and say
'Cause we gon' rock this whole place anyway

(Da Kurlzz: J-Dog!)
J-Dog: White boys with tattoos, pointing right at you
We're breaking everything,
Da Kurlzz and J-Dog: Roudy like a classroom
And when you're runnin' your mouth, our razor blades come out
J-Dog: B-but you always press, and you know I never stress
With Loki DMS, Johnny to my left
Got Phantom and the rest who are down to rep the west
Da Kurlzz and J-Dog: I grew up on by drive by's and LA gang signs
So what the fuck you know about being a gangsta?
(Uh-uh) And what the fuck you know about being in danger?
J-Dog: You ain't doin' this so you know you just talking shit
Mad at all of us 'cause every song is a fucking hit

Deuce: Undead, you better get up out the way
Tomorrow we'll rise, so let's fight today
You know I don't give a fuck what you think and say
'Cause we gon' rock this whole place anyway

Undead, you better get up out the way
Tomorrow we'll rise, so let's fight today
You know I don't give a fuck what you think and say
'Cause we gon' rock this whole place anyway

Da Kurlzz and J3T: Undead, motherfucking time to ride, ride
Undead, I see you duck when we drive by
Undead, motherfucker, it's time to ride, ride
Undead
Why won't you punks just die, die?
Charlie Scene, Da Kurlzz, Deuce, J-Dog, and J3T: Undead!</pre></div>
