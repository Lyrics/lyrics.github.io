    <div class="view"><pre>Hold on holy ghost, go on, hold me close
Better run, here we come, it's the day of the dead

We come from a world of oblivion, bad dreams
I got all I need strapped right to my hamstring
I'm not really bad, I'm just made up of bad things
I'm really not a madman, the voices keep asking
Born with a soul that don't wanna be saved
Every time I look around, I see what a fiend made
Every time I die, I hope they're digging up my grave
An Undead one like the flag that I wave

I'm not afraid to cry from this cocaine sickness
I'm not afraid to die, let the good book witness
I ask and give none, nope, no forgiveness
The day of the dead, and you're on our hit list
So come, all you misfits, bitch, you're on our hit list!

Hold on holy ghost, go on, hold me close
Better run, here we come, it's the day of the dead
Hold on holy ghost, so long to the ones you know
Better run, here we come, it's the day of the dead

This is exactly what has to be done, it happened so gradually
It's like I magically happened to be this phantom that cannot be
Let this dagger cut jaggedly while you're gasping so rapidly
While you gag on this rag, I see you all laughing so happily

It's okay to get startled and be afraid of the dark
I'll just wait here to swallow your soul and tear you apart
And I've already started, there ain't no saving your heart
This is the day of the dead, this ain't no day in the park
Here I come, here I come, grab your guns and crossbows
And run, better run from the skull and crossbones
The fun has begun, yeah, it's hard to swallow
When I'm done, I ain't done 'cause it's hell that follows
Now get ready for sorrow
'Cause it's hell that follows

Hold on holy ghost, go on, hold me close
Better run, here we come, it's the day of the dead
Hold on holy ghost, so long to the ones you know
Better run, here we come, it's the day of the dead

When the ashes start to rise and the moon falls from the sky
And a thousand candles burn into the night
When the angels softly cry, on the plains below the sky
Would a thousand souls still pray for you and I?

Hold on holy ghost, go on, hold me close
Better run, here we come, it's the day of the dead

Hold on holy ghost, go on, hold me close
Better run, here we come, it's the day of the dead
Hold on holy ghost, so long to the ones you know
Better run, here we come, it's the day of the dead

Hold on holy ghost
It's the day of the dead
Hold on holy ghost
It's the day of the dead

Hold on holy ghost
(Here's to the Damned)'
It's the day of the dead
Hold on holy ghost
(Here's to the Damned)
It's the day of the dead</pre></div>
