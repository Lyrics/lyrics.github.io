    <div class="view"><pre>I just can't escape, it's like you're here with me now
But the words you say, they always seem to fade out
Since you've been away, I'm just a face in the crowd
Someday, someday, I know you're coming back

Down in the dirt with your blood on my hands
I blacked out, but now I do understand
That you were too good for this world so you left it
Everything turned red and then you made an exit
I don't even know if it was your time
But like all good things that pass you by
It's like a lost soul in the time of need
It made me grow up fast and put some blood on my knees
And you don't even know what's beyond you
Thinking you could never die like you're bulletproof
So I guess you had to leave, you were born with wings
But you were never happy til the angels sing

I just can't escape, it's like you're here with me now
But the words you say, they always seem to fade out
Since you've been away, I'm just a face in the crowd
Someday, someday, I know you're coming back down
Someday, someday, I know you're coming back down

I'm ashes to ashes, I'm dust to dust
And when a man turns to ashes, forget about love
Like the feeling inside you with the bottle beside you
You both end up empty like an angel just died too
I look to the heavens, to the sky and the rest
I looked inside myself, I felt my heart in my chest
Something so point blue, there's nothing to say
Some hearts to stay true when falling away
Come lay down beside me, what you and I mean
It's only what I've seen it's only just one dream
Tell my baby I love her, and I wish I could hold her
It's hard to say goodbye when you know that it's over

I just can't escape, it's like you're here with me now
But the words you say, they always seem to fade out
Since you've been away, I'm just a face in the crowd
Someday, someday, I know you're coming back down
One day, one day, I know you're coming back down

I know you're coming back, know you're coming back
I know you're coming back down

I know you're coming back, know you're coming back
I know you're coming back down (down)

I know you're coming back, know you're coming back
I know you're coming back down

I know you're coming back, know you're coming back
I know you're coming back down

I know you're coming back down

I just can't escape, it's like you're here with me now
But the words you say, they always seem to fade out
Since you've been away, I'm just a face in the crowd
Someday, someday, I know you're coming back down
Someday, someday, I know you're coming back down
One day, one day, I know you're coming back down</pre></div>
