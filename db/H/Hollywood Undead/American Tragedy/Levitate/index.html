    <div class="view"><pre>Can't stop, I need some help
Fuck you, I'm by myself
Is it a truth or lie?
It's what you can't deny
'Cause it's the way you think
Mixed with the pills and drink
Brought back to the way you are
Float up till you're close to God
You know that hiding ain't gonna keep you safe
Because the tears on your face, they leak and leave a trace (trace)
So just when you think that true love's begun
It goes off at any second just like a loaded gun

You know I can take you straight to Heaven, if you let me
You know I, I can make your body levitate, if you let me
Know that I can make your body levitate, le-levitate-tate
I can make you body levitate, le-levitate, you know

Can't stop the feeling, high as the ceiling
I've got the money, who's fuckin' dealin'?
You feel the heat, like a barrel of a gun
I forgot the last time I saw the sun
We've got this disease, it's diggin' deeper in me
It's like my mind is leaving, but my heart keeps beating
So I'll paint the walls red, drip from the nose
Where it goes, nobody really knows
Hit the bottle, shoes on to follow
I fall asleep, there ain't no tomorrow
Gone too far, no one to save me
Who needs you when I got my baby?
My baby's beautiful, she loves me true
And if she dies, I hope I die too

You know I can take you straight to Heaven, if you let me
You know I, I can make your body levitate, if you let me
Know that I can make your body levitate, le-levitate-tate
I can make you body levitate, le-levitate, you know

I put down another sack of them
Then it's straight back to the flask again
I can't help stop what's happening
On the wrong track, yeah, I'm back again
Up shit's creek and I'm paddlin'
Blacked out room and I'm travelin'
Good ideas, I'm lackin' them
I'm too fucked up now I'm babblin'
Wondering how to fix these damages, all these goddamn damages
Cover myself with bandages from all these d-dam-damages
Wondering how to fix these damages, all these goddamn damages
Cover myself with bandages from all these goddamn damages

You know I can take you straight to Heaven, if you let me
You know I, I can make your body levitate, if you let me
Know that I can make your body levitate, le-levitate-tate
I can make you body levitate, le-levitate, you know
You know</pre></div>
