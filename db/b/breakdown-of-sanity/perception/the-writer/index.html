<title>Breakdown of Sanity â€“ The Writer | Lyrics</title>
<meta name="description" content="It's your turn right now / Let me see your steps, let me feel your hesitation / Nothing ventured, nothing gained / We know the reproach to yourself / All your reflections as an open secret / All your mistakes as a success, your tears as the pitiful disport / Your decisions make us win, follow the guide we gave you / Don't look upward, there's nothing above you, your eyes aren't qualified / Your memory is your future, can you remember your end? / We are your faith and your fear / We are your inspiration and your overload / You're all equal / This is your reality, your veiled sight / You can never see / You can put the blame on us / I see you try to grow with your scars, but you fail again and again / You can put the blame on us, this is what we expect / This makes your life so much easier, just close your eyes, follow blindly / In your deepest dreams you can see us, in your lonely hours you can feel us / This prison was built for you, you are not ready for the outside / Maybe you will never be, maybe you will never see / Nothing is more constant than change / So why don't you change within? / Positions won't change as long as you can't see the point / Till then we will keep observing you..sneering / ________________ / Name The Writer / Artist Breakdown of Sanity / Album Perception"/>
