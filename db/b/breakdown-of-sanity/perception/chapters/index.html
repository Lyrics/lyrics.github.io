Don't even know if there is a right way I could choose</p><p>I go down on my knees, I'm yelling at the ground, in the hope of finding some new answers<br/>Thousands of questions, only one life for finding answers.<br/>One question for thousands of lives - breathing slowly - what if<br/>Despite this I never stopped believing in, waiting for the point I can see it clearly</p></article></div>
