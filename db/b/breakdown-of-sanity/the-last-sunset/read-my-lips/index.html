<title>Breakdown of Sanity â€“ Read My Lips | Lyrics</title>
<meta name="description" content="What's my name? / Who's to blame? / What's your deal? / To dash my hopes? / Read my lips / Feel you nothing? / You know I'll bet you think you have / A good reason to live in your own world / There's a place where you belong / But you're weakened by the poison / Who has fed you with a fucking lie? / They don't believe in you / Don't care about anyone / Trust in nothing - in nothing but in me / The real words seem to hurt you / Well put em' up motherfucker! / Can you feel it?! / Feel me / Can you hear me or are you deaf and dumb?! / Feel you nothing when I stamp it on your face?! / I don't understand why you dig one's own grave? / A fat lot you care / You waste your poor life / You waste your time / We are no one / Feel you nothing? / You know I'll bet you think you have / A good reason to live in your own world / Trust in nothing but in me / Nothing but in me / Trust in nothing / Nothing but in me / I trust in nothing / In nothing but in me / Read My Lips! / Who the fuck you are / Oh no god........No!!! / Take your hand back / It's my life! / __________________ / Name Read My Lips / Artist Breakdown of Sanity / Album The Last Sunset"/>
