<title>Billy Idol â€“ Heroin | Lyrics</title>
<meta name="description" content="Well, I wish, I was born a thousand years ago / And I wish that I sailed the darkened sea / On a great big clipper ship, goin' from this land into that / In a sailors suit and cap away from the big city, away from the big city / Where a man cannot be free / Of all the evils in this town / And of himself and those around / And I'm closing in on death / And I guess that I just don't know / And I guess that I just don't know / Ah, Jesus died for somebody's sins / But not mine / Jesus died for somebody's sins / But not mine / I don't know just where I'm goin', ah / But I'm gonna try for the kingdom if I can, yeah / 'Cause it makes me feel like I'm a man / When I put a spike into my vein / And I tell you, things aren't quite the same / It's a mainline to my pain / ( I can feel it ) / Jesus died for somebody's sins / But not mine, heroin / ( I can feel it ) / Jesus died for somebody's sins / ( I can feel it ) / But not mine, heroin / I said, Jesus died for somebody's sins / But not mine, heroin / I have made a very big decision / I gonna try to nullify my life, you know / I get so low and then the smack flows / I don't care, I'm gonna make it my wife / Because when the blood begins to flow / And shoots up the droopers neck / And I'm closin' in on death, you can all go take a walk / And I guess that I just don't know / And I guess that I just don't know / Jesus died for somebody's sins / But not mine, heroin / Jesus died for somebody's sins / ( I can feel it ) / But not mine, heroin / I said, Jesus died for somebody's sins / But not mine, heroin / I said, Jesus died for somebody's sins / But not mine, heroin / Not mine, heroin, smack attack / Jesus died for somebody's sins / But not mine, heroin / Jesus died for somebody's sins / But not mine, heroin / Jesus died for somebody's sins / But not mine, heroin / I said, Jesus died for somebody's sins / But not mine, heroin, smack attack / Don't touch that needle / V.R., heroin, V.R., heroin, V.R., hell, heroin / (Forever) / And I'm closing in on death, heroin / ____________ / Name Heroin / Artist Billy Idol / Album Cyberpunk / Original text by Lou Reed"/>
