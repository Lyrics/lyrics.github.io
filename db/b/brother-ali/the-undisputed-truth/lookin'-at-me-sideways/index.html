<title>Brother Ali â€“ Lookin' At Me Sideways | Lyrics</title>
<meta name="description" content="Now baby you gon' get a crook in your neck looking at me sideways / I play high stakes made crook in a crime wave / Must be something on my face / Yelling that they ought no tell em what they spellin on MySpace dot com / Bold type face rhetoric / You gon' clickety click and get your head split / What the hell you look like on a message board / Discussing whether or not the brother is hard core / I ain't got to prove to any of you / That anything I ever said was is the truth but I'm ready to do it / And do it leisurely, Ant give 10 beats a week / So fuck it I'll put the record how it needs to be / I understand I ain't perfect alright / I been a thugged out nerd all my life / Thank God I ain't got to serve dirt or snatch purses at night / I feed people with the verses I write / And I fill them with my personal strife / Had some of y'all concerned for my life / For what I've had the nerve to recite / I cut my grass grow, bring the serpants to light / Now baby you ain't never heard me I'm tight / And I'm surgical like, with this bitch Jake / You know that shit fuck around and get a closed casket and I'm old fashioned / Trying to figure out how we got from Whipper Whip to this silly bullshit / It's just so tragic / But it ain't impossible to solve / I ain't learned jack shit from Dorian at all / Let me hear you abusing the culture I adore / I'll come across the hall and get involved like this here / I'm just here to play my part, and inbetween scenes got to stay on guard / I ain't way out y'all, you just don't get me dog / You gon fuck around and miss me dog, it ain't my fault / And they love the way I talk / Eyes get real wide when I say my thoughts / I ain't way out y'all, you just don't get me dog / You gon fuck around and miss me dog, it ain't my fault / Tabernacle my hand, expand to the size of a big black granite statue / Divide it by the lightning speed that they can move / It ain't an autograph, do that math I'm a smack you / I like to pull up my pants and lean back too / Organic vegetables, mix em with fast food / I'm Howard Stern meets Howard Zinn / How could you not find a pal in him and get attracted too / I take it back for you when possible / If your hear this then I'm confiding in you / Pop call me, "Ali what's bothering you / Don't you want to tell your friends you and your father are cool" / "NO." You got more X's than the Honorable Elijah Muhammed do / But that ain't my problem with you / Truth is your just an impossible dude / You get hostile with fools when their honest with you / I could make me a snide little comment or two / But I don't see what that nonsense would prove / I don't give fake props to the dude or walk around in his shoes / I just do what the Qu'ran says to do and respect him / Now I ain't even here to get clandestine / But best believe I'm a get what's destined / Be it an Escalade or a fixed up F10 / It's better than this bus, best friend believe that / I ain't got a free minute to lean back / Spiderman 2 coming out and Faheem need that / Plus I wanna teach him how to read on a Leap Pad / Shining bright, smiling like "look at me dad! " / That's the shit that I'm in to I defend to the death / That I'm every bit as gangster as them fools / If I wasn't G I wouldn't flow like this / If you were really a G you wouldn't know I exist, you bitch / (I don't understand what they're sayin' / But little did they know they could get a smack for that, man) / So I'd advise you to shut the fuck up / Silly muhfucka / I'm just here to play my part, and inbetween scenes got to stay on guard / I ain't way out y'all, you just don't get me dog / You gon fuck around and miss me dog, it ain't my fault / And they love the way I talk / Eyes get real wide when I say my thoughts / I ain't way out y'all, you just don't get me dog / You gon fuck around and miss me dog, it ain't my fault / I said clap your hand to the beat y'all / 'Cause the beat make you clap your hands / I said clap your hand to the beat y'all / 'Cause the beat make you clap your hands / I said clap your hand to the beat y'all / 'Cause the beat make you clap your hands / I said clap your hand to the beat y'all / 'Cause the beat make you clap your hands / ____________________________ / Name Lookin' At Me Sideways / Artist Brother Ali / Album The Undisputed Truth"/>
