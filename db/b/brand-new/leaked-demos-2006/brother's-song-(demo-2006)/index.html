<title>Brand New â€“ Brother's Song (Demo 2006) | Lyrics</title>
<meta name="description" content="So the air's gettin' colder / And the news keeps us scared / I still wrestle this summer / From the bones of our tired, blistered hands / 'Cause tonight we got drinks / With just a couple of friends / And the girl that my brother likes is finally talkin' to him / And his chest is all swelled like he's proud and happy / Like he's got a great idea / Like he's makin' a memory / Wake up / And come out to the car / There's an east swell comin' / And it's howlin' offshore / And we'll be / Lyin' like lions out in the sand / But I'll be dead before you put a gun in my brother's hands / So we make jokes back home / And we lighten the mood / But growing up my parents saw / What sending a kid to fight can really do / And now with the war, I can tell they're a little shook up / 'Cause just a few mothers' sons will never really be enough / Not till half of our names are etched out in the wall / And the other half ruined from the things we saw / Wake up / And come out to the car / There's an east swell comin' / And it's howlin' offshore / And we'll be / Lyin' like lions out in the sand / But I'll be dead before you put a gun in my brother's hands / Wake up / And come out to the car / There's an east swell comin' / And it's howlin' offshore / And we'll be / Lyin' like lions out in the sand / But I'll be dead before you put a gun in my brother's hands / ________________________________ / Name Brother's Song (Demo 2006) / Artist Brand New / Album Leaked Demos 2006"/>
