<meta name="description" content="Please don't be technology / So I can turn up your love like some cold machine / Don't feed me scraps from your bed / I won't be the stray coming back just to be fed / Don't be waves / Come to seal my fate, marine / Just pretend / That you want me / Would you be my babe? / Be my / Well don't be that note I can't hold / Well don't be that joke that I told and told 'til it got old / Don't be that hand 'round my throat so I can't breathe / (so I can't breathe) / Say you're my friend but why won't you be my family? / And if you break / Just don't tell me / Would you be my babe? / (Yeah we were solving it / Yeah we got that scene / No hand to hold arms / Won't do, I'm smart / Why don't you want me? / I'm with the enemy that came and tied my veins) / Be my serene (Tell me now) / Tell me you know what I mean (Prove me wrong) / You've set on me but you are not the sun / You are not the sun. / (Now that I know what I am) / I'm outside and your cold lips again (Put it down) / You've set on me but you are not the sun (I'll come around) / You are not the sun / Just pretend that you love me / And be my bbe / Would you be my babe? / Be my / _________________ / Name Not The Sun / Artist Brand New / Album The Devil And God Are Raging Inside Me"/>
