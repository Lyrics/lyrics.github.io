<title>Brand New â€“ Degausser | Lyrics</title>
<meta name="description" content="Goodbye to sleep / I think this staying up is exactly what I need / We'll take apart your head / We'll take apart the counting / And the flock it has bred / Goodbye to love / That's alright / I will push you all up / Right against the wall / (Does everybody really wanna know the meaning of the word love? / And do you really think you're a part of me? / And is your army ready to take on one of the 144,000? / Or will you declare war on the loony bin?) / Take my head / (Right against the wall) / Chew it up and swallow it / Your blue blood is now running / I fell asleep in the alkaline / I can't shake this little feeling / I'll never get anything right / Goodbye you liar / Well, you sipped from the cup but you don't own up to anything / Then you think you will inspire? / (But now your note really got me worried about this now, and your baby girl / Do you really feel I'm in the Old Testament? / Or will we celebrate with flowers? Or with fire and brimstone? / I just don't know, and yeah; I admit, I'm afraid of the reckoning) / (Take my head) / And I wish I could inspire / (Take apart the demon / In the attic / To the left) / (Goodbye, my love / Don't burn out love / He'll cut your throat / It's not your fault, girl / Shake him off you now! / That's in the trial) / Her blue blood is now running / I fell asleep in the alkaline / I can't shake this little feeling / "I'll never say anything!" / (Why am I on my own for you?) / "I'll never say anything!" / (Why am I on my own for you?) / "I'll never say anything!" / (Why am I on my own for you?) / "I'll never say anything!" / Right?! / Right, my love?! / "Take me, take me back to your bed / I love you so much that it hurts my head / Say: 'I don't mind you under my skin'" / (I let the bad parts in, the bad part is in) / "Well, when we were made we were set apart / But life is a test and I get bad marks / Now some Saint got the job of writing down my sins / The storm is coming, the storm is coming in!" / Her blue blood is now running / I fell asleep in the alkaline / I can't shake this little feeling / "I never did anything!" / (Why am I alone for you?) / "I never did anything!" / (Why am I alone?!) / "Take me, take me back to your bed / I love you so much that it hurts my head / I don't mind you under my skin" / (I'll let the bad parts in, the bad part is in) / "Well, you're my favorite bird and when you sing / I really do wish that you'd wear my ring / No matter what they say I am still The King / Now the storm is coming, the storm is coming in" / _______________ / Name Degausser / Artist Brand New / Album The Devil And God Are Raging Inside Me"/>
