    <div class="view"><div id="lyrics">They told me yesterday
I'd know all what you're about
Stretch my wingspan out to reach you here
I'll always make my move on you

You're right
I've got a long way up from here
My little dream always
Has got to know what you know

So fine
The slammer in my heart is pure
Sometimes I feel I've got the wrong time
And you're just sitting on my lifeline, oh

False reality's in drive
You've got to let it go
Blood, sweat, tears are set aside
Cause it's cooler on the water

Yes it's dryer on the water
Yes it's sweeter on the water
Yes it's better on the water
On the water

I told them yesterday
We men are traveling backwards slowly
By next year there'll be a death parade
Why I am feeling so utterly shamed

You're right
I've got a long way up from here
My little dream always
Has got to know what you know

So fine
The slammer in my heart is pure
Sometimes I feel I've got the wrong time
And you're just sitting on my lifeline, oh

It's sweeter on the water
Yes it's better on the water
On the water

It's sweeter on the water
Yes it's better on the water
On the water

It's sweeter on the water
Yes it's better on the water
On the water</div></div>
