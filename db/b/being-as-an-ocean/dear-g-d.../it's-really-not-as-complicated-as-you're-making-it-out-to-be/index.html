    <div class="view"><article id="lyrics"><p>I do dimly perceive that while everything around me is ever-changing, ever-dying there is, underlying all that change, a living power that is changeless, that holds all together, that creates, dissolves, and recreates.<br/>That informing power or spirit is God, and since nothing else that I see merely through the senses can or will persist, He alone is.<br/>And is this power benevolent or malevolent?<br/>I see it as purely benevolent.<br/>For I can see, that in the midst of death, Life persists, in the midst of untruth, Truth persists, in the midst of darkness, Light persists.<br/>Hence I gather, that God is Life, Truth, Light, He is Love.<br/>He is the supreme good.<br/>But He is no god who merely satisfies the intellect, if He ever does.<br/>God to be God must rule the heart and transform it.<br/>He must express Himself in every smallest act of His votary.<br/>It is proved not by extraneous evidence, but in the transformed conduct and character of those who have felt the real presence of God within.<br/>To reject this evidence is to deny oneself.<br/>This realization is preceded by an immovable faith.<br/>He who would, in his own person, test the fact of God's presence can do so by a living faith, and since faith itself cannot be proved by extraneous evidence, the safest course is to believe in...; the law of Truth and Love.<br/>Exercise of faith will be the safest where there is a clear determination summarily to reject all that is contrary to Truth and Love.<br/>I confess that I have no argument to convince through reason, faith transcends reason.<br/>All that I can advise is not to attempt the impossible.</p></article></div>
