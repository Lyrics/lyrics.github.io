<title>Being As An Ocean â€“ The Hardest Part Is Forgetting Those You Swore You Would Never Forget | Lyrics</title>
<meta name="description" content="There sit two lovers / One's eyes intently chasing the other's / She doesn't love him anymore / But he'll stick it out till the end / This he had sworn / Lying awake in bed / Feeling the spot on my chest / Where you used to rest your head / You see love's a funny thing the way it lingers in the mind / No matter what you do or the passing of time / That ember still glows for those lovers behind / No matter if it's well remembered / That light still shines / Good times take precedent over every incident / No matter how poorly spent / So we put on these ridiculous fronts / Like we were just fooling around / Our love was only childish fun / Yet we know different / That it meant something to us / And that piece still lingers in each one that we've loved / So we pick up the pieces / Try and make a half a whole / But in the back of our minds / There's quite a different story to be told / That Love has kissed our lips / That Love has touched our eyes / And no matter how sincere / Love has changed our lives / And even if all love has flown / We'll have a few scars to proudly show / Cause at the end of our lives / We can say, 'At least we tried' / Lying awake in bed / Feeling the spot on my chest / Where you used to rest your head / ___________________________________________________________________________ / Name The Hardest Part Is Forgetting Those You Swore You Would Never Forget / Artist Being As An Ocean / Album Dear G-D..."/>
