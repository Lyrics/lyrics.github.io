<title>Being As An Ocean â€“ This Room Is Alive | Lyrics</title>
<meta name="description" content="This room's alive / Breathing / In this moment, each one of us is leaving / All of life's worries and troubles far behind / Speaking in tongues / Sweating blood / Rapture / Some people search their entire lives for such a cure / Screaming silently inside / Past horrors plaguing their minds / This is our release / This is our violent plea / Hearts scarred and bandaged / Souls weathered and damaged / This is our release / Our violent plea / It's time to burn the past / Take off our self-fabricated coping masks / We'll let each other see who we really are / With our broken limbs and battle scars / Naked, all things stripped away / You'll see we've all gone through similar pains / And like children, we count and play our hiding games / But we won't come inside when Grace calls our name / Slaves to our guilt and shame / Pointing the finger at the one who was never really to blame / Ourselves / Reopen your wounds anew / And watch the broken come to stand by you / You don't have to feel alone / Cause I know this place could feel like home / There is no need to run and hide / When your true family is standing by your side / ________________________ / Name This Room Is Alive / Artist Being As An Ocean / Album Dear G-D..."/>
