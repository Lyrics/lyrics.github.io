<title>Bring Me The Horizon â€“ The House of Wolves | Lyrics</title>
<meta name="description" content="Show me a sign, show me a reason to give / A solitary fuck about your goddamn beliefs / I'm going blind but one thing's clear / Death is the only salvation you'll feel / Brick by brick by brick / Brick by brick by brick / What you call faith, I call a sorry excuse / Cloak and daggers murder the truth / The bitter taste, there's nothing else / I'll bow for your King when He shows Himself / Brick by brick by brick / These walls begin to cave in / The house of wolves you built / Whispers in a thousand tongues / Show me Your face, show me a reason to think / My soul can be saved if I sell You my sins / I'm going blind but one thing's clear / Death is the only salvation for me / Brick by brick by brick / These walls begin to cave in / The house of wolves you built / Whispers in a thousand tongues / The house of wolves you built (The house of wolves you built) / The nest of wolves you built (The nest of wolves you built) / The house of wolves you built / Will burn just like a thousand suns / So when you die, the only kingdom you'll see / Is two foot wide and six foot deep / Yeah / And when you die, the only kingdom you'll see / Is two foot wide and six foot deep / And when you die, the only kingdom you'll see / Is two foot wide and six foot deep, oh / Brick by brick by brick / Brick by brick by brick / Brick by brick by brick / These walls begin to cave in / The house of wolves you built / Whispers in a thousand tongues / Brick by brick by brick / These walls begin to cave in / The house of wolves you built / Will burn just like a thousand suns / You said you want me, now I'm here / Now I'm here, now I'm here / You said you want me, now I'm here / Now I'm here, now I'm here / _________________________ / Name The House of Wolves / Artist Bring Me The Horizon / Album Sempiternal"/>
