<div><pre>It's the start of the end, surrender the throne
The blood on my hands covered the holes
We've been surrounded by vicious cycles
And we're truly alone
The scars on your heart are yours to atone
We've been surrounded, let 'em sing, let 'em sing

The deeper you dig, the darker it gets
There's nowhere else for us to go
We live while we learn and then we forget
We'll never find our way back home, come on

They came like moths to a flame
You left like a house in a hurricane

(The wolves are at my door)

It's the start of the end, surrender the throne
The blood on my hands covered the holes
We've been surrounded by vicious cycles
It's the start of the end and we're truly alone
The scars on your heart are yours to atone
We've been surrounded, let 'em sing, let 'em sing

I hear them clawing at the gates (Let us in, let us in)
I hear them calling out my name (I don't care)

Let them sing, let them sing, let them sing
Let them bastards sing
Let them sing, let them sing
Let them bastards sing
Let them sing, let them sing
Let them bastards sing
Let them godforsaken bastards sing

They came like moths to a flame
You left like a house in a hurricane

The wolves are at my door
But I can't see the writin' on the walls
The wolves are at my door
Waiting for my empire to fall

It's the start of the end, surrender the throne
The blood on my hands covered the holes
We've been surrounded by vicious cycles
It's the start of the end, and we're truly alone
The scars on your heart are yours to atone
We've been surrounded, let 'em sing, let 'em sing!</pre></div>
