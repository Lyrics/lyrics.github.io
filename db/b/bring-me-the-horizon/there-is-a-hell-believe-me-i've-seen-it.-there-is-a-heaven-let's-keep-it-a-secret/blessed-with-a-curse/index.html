<title>Bring Me The Horizon â€“ Blessed With A Curse | Lyrics</title>
<meta name="description" content="Ever since it began / I was blessed with a curse / I was better off for worse / I was born into a hearse / I know I sang my heart beats for you / I was lying girl / It beats for two / Cause I've got your love / And I've got these voices / Take back! / Every word I've said ever said to you / Take back! / Every word I've said ever said to you / Ever since it began / I was blessed with a curse / And for better or for worse / I was born into a hearse / I know I said my heart beats for you / I was lying girl / I've been lying to you / Everything I touch turns to stone (turns to stone) / So when you are around me / Just leave me on my own / Everything I touch turns to stone (turns to stone) / So when you are around me / Just leave me on my own / Take back! / Every word I've said ever said to you / Take back! / Every word I've said ever said to you / Take back! / Every word I've said ever said to you / Take back! / Every word I've said / Because.. / Everything I've said turn to stone (turns to stone) / So when you are around me / Just leave me on my own / Take back / Every word I've said ever said to you / Take back / Every word I've said every word I've said / Take back / Every word I've said ever said to you / Take back / Every word I've said ever said to you / Take back / Every word I've said every word I've said / Take back / Every word I've said ever said to you / (Take back) / (Everything I've said) / __________________________ / Name Blessed With A Curse / Artist Bring Me The Horizon / Album There is a Hell Believe Me I've Seen It. There is a Heaven Let's Keep it a Secret"/>
