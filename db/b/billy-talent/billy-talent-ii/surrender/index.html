<title>Billy Talent â€“ Surrender | Lyrics</title>
<meta name="description" content="She reads a book from across the street / Waiting for someone that she'll never meet / Talk over coffee for an hour or two, she / Wonders why I'm always in a good mood / Killin' time before she struts her stuff / She needs supporting, I'll become the crutch / She'll never know how much she means to me / I play the game but I'm the referee / Surrender every word, every thought every sound / Surrender every touch, every smile, every frown / Surrender all the pain we've endured until now / Surrender all the hope that I lost you have found / Surrender yourself to me / Even though I know what I'm lookin' for / She's got a brick wall behind her door / I'd travel time and confess to her / But I'm afraid she'd shoot the messenger / Surrender every word, every thought every sound / Surrender every touch, every smile, every frown / Surrender all the pain we've endured until now / Surrender all the hope that I lost you have found / Surrender yourself to me / I think I found a flower in a field of weeds / I think I found a flower in a field of weeds / Searching until my hands bleed / This flower don't belong to me / I think I found a flower in a field of weeds / I think I found a flower in a field of weeds / Searching until my hands bleed / This flower don't belong to me / This flower don't belong to me / Why can't she belong to me? / Every word, every thought, every sound / Every touch, every smile, every frown / All the pain we've endured until now / All the hope that I lost you have found / Surrender every word, every thought, every sound / Surrender every touch, every smile, every frown / Surrender all the pain we've endured until now / Surrender all the hope that I lost you have found / I never had the nerve to ask (surrender) / Has my moment come and passed (surrender) / I never had the nerve to ask (surrender) / Has my moment come and passed (surrender) / I never had the nerve to ask (surrender) / Has my moment come and passed (surrender) / I never had the nerve to ask (surrender) / _______________ / Name Surrender / Artist Billy Talent / Album Billy Talent II"/>
