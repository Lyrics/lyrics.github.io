Face to face you'll hear them tell a different story
Loose lips may sink ships, but honesty's forever
Eyes of envy try to cut and try to sever

Cowards that hide behind their words

Beware the voice without a face
That's hidden underneath them

Covered in cowardice, can't you see them?
Covered in cowardice, can't you hear them?
Beware the voice without a face

Covered in cowardice, can't you see them?
Covered in cowardice, can't you hear them?
Cowards that hide behind their words
Don't care whose feelings will get hurt
Their eyes are blinded by their rage
Beware the voice without a face

Covered in cowardice, can't you hear them?
Cowards that hide behind their words
Don't care whose feelings will get hurt
Their eyes are blinded by their rage
Beware the voice without a face

A voice without a face, a voice without a face
A voice without a</pre></div>
