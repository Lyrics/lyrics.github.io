<title>Billy Talent â€“ Ghost Ship of Cannibal Rats | Lyrics</title>
<meta name="description" content="Respect! Is never given enough today. / I'm tired of looking the other way. / Respect! An appetite that we can't sustain. / We're on a mission to kiss our days away. / So how long before the rivers start to rise dear? / Yeah I thank my lucky stars to be alive here. / Respect! A generation of castaways, / Under a nation of tidal waves. / Are we the passengers or the prey? / You can't escape from the past on holiday. / So how long before the rivers start to rise dear? / Pack your bags because the tides is getting high. / Don't be afraid of the view from the corner because, / That's just the Captain and Crew jumping off of the mast. / All aboard on the Ghost Ship Of Cannibal Rats! / All aboard on the Ghost Ship Of Cannibal Rats! / Who's gonna sound the alarm when the bridges collapse. / This is the point where the bomb reaches critical mass. / All aboard on the Ghost Ship Of Cannibal Rats! / All aboard on the Ghost Ship Of Cannibal Rats! / Catastrophic events don't change. / Today we face but tomorrow we pay. / But don't you worry cause we'll be safe. / I've got a ticket to piss your days away. / So how long before the rivers start to rise dear? / Yeah I thank my lucky stars to be alive here. / Don't be afraid of the view from the corner because, / That's just the Captain and Crew jumping off of the mast. / All aboard on the Ghost Ship Of Cannibal Rats! / All aboard on the Ghost Ship Of Cannibal Rats! / Who's gonna sound the alarm when the bridges collapse. / This is the point where the bomb reaches critical mass. / All aboard on the Ghost Ship Of Cannibal Rats! / All aboard on the Ghost Ship Of Cannibal Rats! / Don't be afraid of the view from the corner because, / That's just the Captain and Crew jumping off of the mast. / All aboard on the Ghost Ship Of Cannibal Rats! / All aboard on the Ghost Ship Of Cannibal Rats! / Who's gonna sound the alarm when the bridges collapse. / This is the point where the bomb reaches critical mass. / All aboard on the Ghost Ship Of Cannibal Rats! / All aboard on the Ghost Ship Of Cannibal Rats! / We're sailing from the coast. / Disappearing too fast. / We're sailing from the coast. / Sunken into the past. / All aboard on the Ghost Ship Of Cannibal Rats! / All aboard on the Ghost Ship Of Cannibal Rats! / We're sailing from the coast. / Disappearing too fast. / We're sailing the coast. / We can never never come back. / All aboard on the Ghost Ship Of Cannibal Rats! / All aboard on the Ghost Ship Of Cannibal Rats! / _________________________________ / Name Ghost Ship of Cannibal Rats / Artist Billy Talent / Album Afraid of Heights"/>
