<title>Billy Talent â€“ This Is Our War | Lyrics</title>
<meta name="description" content="Once there was a nation here, / Now there is no more. / Once we fought to change our fears, / But now This Is Our War. / (This Is Our War!) / (This Is Our War!) / Wash you mind out, where's your morals? / How many people have to live this sorrow? / Rights should not be begged or borrowed / How many really want to change tomorrow? / We're still playing the blindfold game, / As we profile the enemy that we create, yeah. / We're still playing the blindfold game, / With the cards on the table in the end we're all the same! / Where's the compassion in the world today?! / Yeah were all the same! / until we find another way this our war! / Once there was a nation here, / Now there is no more. / (This Is Our War!) / Once we fought for change arm in arm, but / Now This Is Our War. / Divisive words from ivory towers, / Seeds of intolerance turn into flowers. / Countless fools and reckless cowards, / Rally the people in their quest for power. / We're still playing the blindfold game, / As we profile the enemy that we create, yeah. / We're still playing the blindfold game, / With the cards on the table in the end we're all the same! / Where's the compassion in the world today? / Now we're all the same / Until we find another way This Is Our War! / (This Is Our War!) / Once there was a nation here, / Now there is no more! / (This Is Our War!) / Once we fought for change arm in arm, but / Now This Is Our War. / Is this the land of segregation? Is this a place that we call home? / Don't let the old-stock generation carry the flag for you and me no more. / (This Is Our) WAR! This Is Our War. / We're into the red. We're into the red. And as it burns the fire spreads. / We're under the threat. We're under the threat. Will it still burn tomorrow? / Once there was a nation here, / now there is no more! / Once we fought to change our fears, / but now this is our war. / (This is our war!) / Once there was a nation here, / now there is no more! / (This is our war!) / Once we fought for change arm in arm, but / Now this is our war. / Is this the land of segregation? Is this a place that we call home? / Don't let the old-stock generation carry the flag for you and me no more. / (This is our war!) / Once there was a nation divided, / now this is our war. / (This is our war!) / Once we stand embraced arm in arm / We stand for something more! / _____________________ / Name This Is Our War / Artist Billy Talent / Album Afraid of Heights"/>
