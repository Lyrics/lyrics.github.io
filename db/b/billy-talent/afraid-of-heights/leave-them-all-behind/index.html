<title>Billy Talent â€“ Leave Them All Behind | Lyrics</title>
<meta name="description" content="Tired of all the promises and never coming through. / It's easy to pretend until they turn their back on you. / And all the ones that bring you down, their colours weren't that true. / And life's become a battle that you swore you'd never lose. / It don't matter what went wrong this time, don't matter what went right. / We're always searching for the reason why... / And the longest road to find it will take many years to climb. / Don't wait up for that moment to arrive... / Leave Them All Behind. / Well I'm tired of all the promises and never coming through. / It's easy to pretend until they turn their back on you. / And all the ones that bring you down, their colours weren't that true. / And when you lose your confidence your mind plays tricks on you. / It don't matter what went wrong this time, don't matter what went right. / We're always searching for the reason why... / And the longest road to find it will take many years to climb. / We keep on getting stuck here all the time. / We're gonna Leave Them All Behind. / We're gonna Leave Them All Behind. / We're gonna catch that train, the words they say couldn't stop us if they tried. / We're gonna Leave Them All Behind. / We're gonna Leave Them All Behind. / We're gonna catch that train I know some day everything's gonna fall in line. / I've been struck down and defeated every step along the way. / Become I'm your own worst enemy when nothing seems to change. / You have to fail a thousand times before you get it straight. / So catch me if you can 'cause I ain't leaving this to fate. / It don't matter what went wrong this time, don't matter what went right. / We're always searching for the reason why... / And the longest road to find it will take many years to climb. / We keep on getting stuck here all the time. / We're gonna leave them all behind! / We're gonna leave them all behind! / We're gonna catch that train, the words they say couldn't stop us if they tried. / We're gonna leave them all behind! / We're gonna leave them all behind! / We're gonna catch that train I know some day, everything's gonna fall in line. / Tired of all the promises and never coming through. / Stop waiting for that moment to arrive... / We're gonna leave them all behind! / We're gonna leave them all behind! / We're gonna catch that train, the words they say couldn't stop us if they tried. / We're gonna leave them all behind! / We're gonna leave them all behind! / We're gonna catch that train I know some day, everything's gonna fall in line. / We're gonna leave them all behind! / We're gonna leave them all behind! / We're gonna catch that train I know some day, everything's gonna fall in line. / Yeah! / ___________________________ / Name Leave Them All Behind / Artist Billy Talent / Album Afraid of Heights"/>
