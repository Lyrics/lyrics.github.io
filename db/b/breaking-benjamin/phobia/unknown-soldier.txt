Borderline, dead inside, I don't mind falling to pieces
Count me in, violent, let's begin feeding the sickness
How do I simplify? Dislocate, the enemy's on the way

Show me what it's like to dream in black and white
So I can leave this world tonight

Full of fear, ever clear, I'll be here fighting forever
Curious, venomous, you'll find me climbing to heaven
Never mind, turn back time, you'll be fine; I will get left behind

Show me what it's like to dream in black and white
So I can leave this world tonight
Holding on too tight, breathe the breath of life
So I can leave this world behind

It only hurts just once
They're only broken bones
Hide the hate inside

(So I can leave this world behind)

Show me what it's like to dream in black and white
So I can leave this world tonight
Holding on too tight, breathe the breath of life
So I can leave this world behind
