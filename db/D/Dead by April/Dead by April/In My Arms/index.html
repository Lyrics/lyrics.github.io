Close your eyes, know I'm here (Here)
I know it's hard to let go all that defines you
You feel like you'll never be whole again

We will find a way to erase the past
Stay with me, stay with me

In my arms you'll be fine, I'll never let go
All you've lost will come again, just stay here with me
Never look back, never again, it's over
Everything ends here in my arms

Don't give in, don't let your memories break you
Let me take you away from here (Here)

We will find a way to make this last
Stay with me, stay with me

In my arms you'll be fine, I'll never let go
All you've lost will come again, just stay here with me
Never look back, never again, it's over
Everything ends here in my arms

I'll be here forever
Everything ends here in my arms
I'll be here forever
Everything ends in my arms
I'll be here forever, forever
Forever

In my arms (In my arms)
You'll be fine (You'll be fine)
I'll never let go
All you've lost (All you've lost)
Will come again (Will come again)
Just stay here with me
Never look back (Never look back)
Never again (Never again)
It's over
Everything ends here in my arms</pre></div>
