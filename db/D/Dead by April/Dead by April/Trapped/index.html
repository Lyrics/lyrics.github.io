    <div class="view"><pre>(Try not to wake me)

'Cause of you, I'm lyin' awake at night
All I'm seeing are pictures of you
As I close my eyes
I fade my way into the laws of my dream world

It's a place of trust, will you meet me there?
There's no time to spare; come on, show me you care
Here we can make anything become real

All of my dreams are all I see
Try not to wake me, can't you see
All of my dreams are all I wanna see?
Try not to wake me, try not to wake me

'Cause of you, my tries do not think of you
They just end up in one million thoughts
It's way too much to mention
See what I mean when you see my creation

It's a place of trust, I can meet you there
There's no time to spare; come on, show me you care
What you believe, it will here become real

All of my dreams are all I see
Try not to wake me, can't you see
All of my dreams are all I wanna see?
Try not to wake me, try not to wake me

All of my dreams are all I see
Try not to wake me, can't you see
All of my dreams are all I wanna see?
Try not to wake me, try not to wake me

Trapped inside my own dreams, I'm not complaining
Leave behind a lie of any kind, here it can disappear

All of my dreams are all I see
Try not to wake me, let me be

All of my dreams are all I see (I see)
Try not to wake me, can't you see (Can't you see)
All of my dreams are all I wanna see?
Try not to wake me (No), try not to wake me

All of my dreams are all I see (I see)
Try not to wake me, can't you see (Can't you see)
All of my dreams are all I wanna see? (No)
Try not to wake me, try not to wake me

(Try not to wake me)</pre></div>
