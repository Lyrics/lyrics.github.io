    <div class="view"><pre>Gone are the flames
Gone are the tears and pain
That burned me that hurt me
Some days I could barely get through
Still I knew I stood never too far from you

Look at me now, I made it
Feel my heart now, I made it
Reaching things now, I never thought possible
Here I am now, I made it
Here is my life, my true dream

I'm not afraid
Even through the darkest moment
I never gave up
In my mind what I'm reaching for
Is coming closer
My dream never faded out
I never gave it up

Look at me now, I made it
Feel my heart now, I made it
Reaching things now, I never thought possible
Here I am now, I made it
Here is my life, my true dream

I saw you in me
I felt you near me
I felt you near me
I saw you in me
I never gave up
I never gave it up

Look at me now, I made it
Look at me now, I made it
Feel my heart now, I made it
Look at me now I made it (look at me now)
Feel my hope now, I made it (look at me now)
Reaching things now, I never thought possible
Here I am now, I made it
Here is my life, my true dream</pre></div>
