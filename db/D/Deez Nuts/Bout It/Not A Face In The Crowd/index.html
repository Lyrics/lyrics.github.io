There's a place in my heart, for everyone of you that shows love and support
Not a day I don't count my blessings, for that chance I've been given and I know who's
Responsible everyone of you made us everything we are, and I know without you none
Of this shits possible. No matter what the fuck life throws at us, when we take the
Stage none of that shit matters. when we hear your voices when we feelin' that vibe
I know there's no place else I'd rather be or feel more alive

If you care then I care cause you made it, possible for me to stay rejuvenated, invigorated
Mind elevated feel loved not hated on stages where I demonstrate it

And let me see you throw your hands up if you believe this shit
