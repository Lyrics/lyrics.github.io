    <div class="view"><pre>Can you hear those birds sing?

Means we're closer to shore
Means we're closer to home
Further from love and war
Further from what made sense
What we were born to do
What kept the blood in our veins
Keep my veins thin with booze

Kept my hand on my gun
And my gun by my side
Kept the moon in my thoughts
With the sun in my eyes

Kept my head hanging low
Kept my gun by my side
My brother's name in my head
And the tears from my eyes

Kept the blood in my veins
Kept the blood in my veins
Brother's name in my head
Kept the blood in my veins

Had me praying for death
For me and my friends
So we would never wake up
To our lovers again

Because every lover had lied
When they said we'd be fine
When they said in good faith
They would sleep alone every night

Hope to come home in one piece
With our boys by our side

Now we're ragged and the torn
Like the flags that we fly
Like the ones we lay down
On a coffin so clean

See those eyes staring back
The boys we used to be

Kept the blood in my veins
(I re-read the postcards you sent, wish the truth was a lie)
Kept the blood in my veins
(The waves on the hull, throw your words off the side)
Brother's name in my head
(The ship takes the deed and dying back home)
And the blood in my veins
(I want to sing to the depths, with the letters you wrote)

Kept the blood in my veins
Kept the blood in my veins
Brother's name in my head
And the blood in my veins

Kept the blood in my veins</pre></div>
