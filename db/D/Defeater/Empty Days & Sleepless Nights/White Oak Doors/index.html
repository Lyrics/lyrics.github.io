<br/><span></span>Put down that drink, your steps creaking the floor.
<br/><span></span>Go and get the gun, distract yourself from death.
<br/><span></span>Back against the door, your hands are starting to sweat.
<br/><span></span>Slowly cock the gun, slowly move to the side,
<br/><span></span>Slowly turn the handle, slowly open it wide.
<br/><span></span>You catch a glimpse of his face. Your heart sinks in your chest;
<br/><span></span>Your hands start to shake because you know that it's him.
<br/><span></span>Just the coward and you standing silent, dead air.
<br/><span></span>So you pull him inside into your father's chair.
<br/><span></span>"Your mother is dead, all thanks to you.
<br/><span></span>Her addiction got worse after you left you damn fool.
<br/><span></span>What you did to our father, I promised you'd pay up.
<br/><span></span>I'm going to take your life, but it don't feel like enough."
<br/><span></span>Cold steel to his head, walk him to his death.<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>Walk him down past the white oak doors.
<br/><span></span>Walk him out past the boardwalk and your old shipyard.
<br/><span></span>Your pistol in his side, make him pay.
<br/><span></span>On the outskirts of town, pass the old quarry now.
<br/><span></span>Walk him down to those cold steel tracks.
<br/><span></span>You stumble drunk with the gun in his back.<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>"Now get down on your knees on the tracks where you shamed me.
<br/><span></span>But this time, the dodge ain't going to end so pretty.
<br/><span></span>Either a bullet or that train steaming just ahead
<br/><span></span>Is going to end your days. You coward little kid."<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>You sit and you stir, while he waits for his death.
<br/><span></span>You'll never forgive him, and you never did forget.
<br/><span></span>He'll never see the sun again.
<br/><span></span>Make him pay off his debt.
<br/><span></span>Stand on those tracks, cold steel under your feet,
<br/><span></span>Barrel to his temple. "Your rotting mother, you will soon re-meet,"
<br/><span></span>You whisper in his ear, feel his whole body shake.
<br/><span></span>In an instant he's got your arm, he's got your gun, you're held down by his weight.
<br/><span></span>You feel the cold steel above and below.
<br/><span></span>You feel your stomach tie in knots when the train whistle blows.
<br/><span></span>You feel the warm of the blood where the barrel digs in.
<br/><span></span>From your cheek to your mouth, you taste the sweat and the tin.
<br/><span></span>You don't cry, you don't beg. You've been waiting for this.
<br/><span></span>For the coward, or for death, just to see your wife again.
<br/><span></span>That train is so close, so loud and so clear.
<br/><span></span>Your hands stop shaking and it's all that you hear.
<br/><span></span>Just like father. "You took him.
<br/><span></span>If this is how it's going to be
<br/><span></span>I would rather die at the hands of my own family."<br/><span></span><br/><span></span><br/></div><hr/><table><tbody><tr><td>Song name&nbsp;</td><td>White Oak Doors</td><tr><td>Artist&nbsp;</td><td>Defeater</td><tr><td>Album&nbsp;</td><td>Empty Days & Sleepless Nights</td></tbody></table></div></div></div><script>var input=document.createElement("input");input.name="q";input.type="search";input.placeholder="Search";document.getElementsByTagName("nav")[0].appendChild(input)</script>
