"where you from, where you been?" the boy would ask. he could never answer, it was the truth he lacked. "i'm from nowhere kid, i've been to hell and back. i'm a loner kid, i got no grace and no tact." he had nothing more than those simple words. he was a runner and a coward always losing his way. still no sleep for him. "i ain't no wicked man." there would be no night like this for him ever again. he would change his fate, he would mend the breaks. he left that night with parting words to lead his way. "don't you be like me." and so that moonlit sky shined praise down on him.<br/><span></span><br/><span></span><br/></div><hr/><table><tbody><tr><td>Song name&nbsp;</td><td>Moon Shine</td><tr><td>Artist&nbsp;</td><td>Defeater</td><tr><td>Album&nbsp;</td><td>Travels</td></tbody></table></div></div><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/></div><script>var input=document.createElement("input");input.name="q";input.type="search";input.placeholder="Search";document.getElementsByTagName("nav")[0].appendChild(input)</script>
