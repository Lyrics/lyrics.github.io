<br/><span></span>ha!
<br/><span></span>try to follow.<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>inside I'm crying, dying to ask why
<br/><span></span>We're working for nothng from 9 to 5
<br/><span></span>I can feel the exhaustion wearing on me
<br/><span></span>can't face the fact that -
<br/><span></span>I am not free<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>freedom is a lie we learned to believe
<br/><span></span>like a book with no pages we pretend to read
<br/><span></span>you envy me - let me tell you where I came from
<br/><span></span>I ran like hell through my imaganation
<br/><span></span>just to get away from what i did not understand
<br/><span></span>like how a boy becomes a coward and calls himself a men
<br/><span></span>and everyone around him pats him on the back
<br/><span></span>happily obvious ignoring all the facts
<br/><span></span>knick knack paddi whack give a dog a bone
<br/><span></span>sit, stay, roll over, run away from home
<br/><span></span>this is what we teach to the demons we create
<br/><span></span>avoid your inner conscience,
<br/><span></span>and hide from your mistakes
<br/><span></span>then lie awake hunted by your messed up thoughts
<br/><span></span>contemplating actions afraid of getting caught<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>this is how we're waiting on the edge
<br/><span></span>for the problems that haven't happened yet
<br/><span></span>paranoia is crawling into our head because
<br/><span></span>this is how we're waiting on the edge<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>I wonder why we're still falling for the same old tricks
<br/><span></span>it seems like we're  all broken and need to be fixed
<br/><span></span>were like robots aboarding the economy that failing anyway
<br/><span></span>and won't let us be who we wanna be
<br/><span></span>its sickening a world on the go
<br/><span></span>I need a triple tall hot latte and a blueberry scone
<br/><span></span>and for lunch, I'll take number 5
<br/><span></span>with a large diet coke
<br/><span></span>and an extra side of fries
<br/><span></span>and you can feed me lies
<br/><span></span>I'll eat them up to
<br/><span></span>at night I pray to god and ask him what to do<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>this is how wer'e wating on the edge
<br/><span></span>for the problems that haven't happened yet
<br/><span></span>paranoia is crawling into our head because
<br/><span></span>this is how we're waiting on te edge<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>and millions of children, dying of hunger
<br/><span></span>we cant see the lightning, cant hear the thunder
<br/><span></span>we are going under
<br/><span></span>if things don't change soon
<br/><span></span>the world will be dead by tomorrow at noon
<br/><span></span>raped of her glory
<br/><span></span>raped of her life
<br/><span></span>raped like the husbands rape their wives
<br/><span></span>and the wives have also lost their minds
<br/><span></span>drowning their kids
<br/><span></span>and feeding them lies…<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>all in favor of a new world say I
<br/><span></span>all in favor say I
<br/><span></span>all in favor of a new world say I
<br/><span></span>all in favor say I, aye<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>I don't wanna sit and wait for shit to hit the fan
<br/><span></span>but you can, if you want
<br/><span></span>with the family you brought
<br/><span></span>to the land of all promises
<br/><span></span>where all you ever wanted was a chance to take a stand
<br/><span></span>against the world that took your confidence
<br/><span></span>because you have been on it since
<br/><span></span>the day you turned ten
<br/><span></span>and your dad said you have to earn your money to spend
<br/><span></span>thats what you did - you became part of the system
<br/><span></span>working to earn a respect of old rich men.
<br/><span></span>shining their shoes, and pressing their pants
<br/><span></span>playing their games and dancing their dance
<br/><span></span>basically home to get a chance -
<br/><span></span>a chance to get notice, to maybe advance
<br/><span></span>but, let me let you in on a little secret -
<br/><span></span>you can package your pride, and tell theme to keep it
<br/><span></span>because you dont need them. they need you caus' you feed them
<br/><span></span>you do the work while they sit tall cause you are lucky you have a job at all
<br/><span></span>right?<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>this is how we're waiting on the edge
<br/><span></span>for the problems that haven't happened yet
<br/><span></span>paranoia is crawling into our head because
<br/><span></span>this is how we're waiting on the edge<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>so one more time everybody, alright.<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>this is how we're waiting on the edge
<br/><span></span>for the problems that haven't happened yet
<br/><span></span>paranoia is crawling into our head because
<br/><span></span>this is how we're waiting on the edge<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>here we go<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>all in favor of a new world say I
