    <div class="view"><pre>I believe its time for me to be famous,
And out of place
I believe its time for me to move for forward,
When I break through
When I break through
When I break through
When I break through

This time I'll, make you,
Proud to see me overcome all day life,
Proud of, who'd you raised,
Your shelter, your peacefulness

So this time I'll make you proud

Proud of, who you raised up,
You know that I will,
Always be here till' the end

Come back, so I, can say, thank you for this,
Home cooked meals, and a place to rest,
My troubled head when you're away,
I've passed the test, I've earned an A,
Not just in school, but in life,
You'll always be right by my side,
To help me show, hope to all,
That are lost and sick in this dying world,
I'll use the love you left behind,
I'll change their minds, I'll change, their, minds

I hope, I hope you smile,
When you look down on me,
I hope, you smile

This can't, we won't know,
I hope that I make you proud

This is not, what it is, only baby scars, (Those baby scars)
I need your love, like a boy needs his mother's side (Well I need your side)

This is not, what it is, only baby scars, (What's only scars)
I need your love, like a boy needs his mother's side (Mother's side)

This is not, what it is, only baby scars,
I need your love, like a boy needs his mother's side,
Yeah</pre></div>
