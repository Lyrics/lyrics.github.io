    <div class="view"><pre>When your reflection in the mirror
Smiles back it lies, you know it
When you lay your head to sleep at night
It's filled with every moment
Every chance you miss to be something
Well learn from your mistakes
You're not alone you're with me

You're not alone you're with me

Don't let the world bring you down
There's always hope for the willing
Don't let the world bring you down
It's not over, you're not alone anymore

When it feels like all is lost
And there's no guide that's left to prove it
Take a look inside, cherish your life
And live before you lose it
You're all waiting for the answer
Keep on searching, strength in numbers

Don't let the world bring you down
There's always hope for the willing
Don't let the world bring you down
It's not over, you're not alone anymore

At the end of the day, what will you choose?
Will you keep moving on or be forced to lose?
Look inside of yourself 'cause the power's in you
There is always hope, you're not alone

Anymore

Don't let the world bring you down
(Don't let the world bring you down)
There's always hope for the willing
Don't let the world bring you down
(Don't let the world bring you down)
It's not over, you're not alone anymore

Don't let the world bring you down
(Don't let the world bring you down)
Don't let the world bring you down (I'm not alone)
Don't let the world bring you down
(Don't let the world bring you down)
It's not over, we're not alone anymore</pre></div>
