    <div class="view"><pre>Even though I can see it in your face
I can't really explain
Just how broken and empty and disgraced
You seem to be (To be)

You cut me out and dragged me down
Pulled me all the way to the bottom
I've done for you, till black and blue
What no one else would do for the fallen

One day when nothing ever feels the same
Just like every other time before
You hit the wall and lost it all
And I'll find a way to wake you from this bed you've made
Even though I know you want me to
I'm never giving up on you

On you, on you
I'm never giving up, never giving up on you
On you, on you
I'm never giving up
I'm never giving up on you

You'll never know just how hard it is for me
To see you this way (This way)

It tears me up, it drags me down
Tryin' to pull you up from the bottom
I break for you like I always do
I'll see you through when you're on your knees and crawling
Crawling

One day when nothing ever feels the same
Just like every other time before
You hit the wall and lost it all
And I'll find a way to wake you from this bed you've made
Even though I know you want me to
I'm never giving up on you

On you, on you
I'm never giving up, never giving up on you
On you, on you
I'm never giving up
I'm never giving up on you

So don't give up on me (On me)
Yeah, don't you give up on me (Give up on me)
Yeah, don't you give up on me
Yeah, don't you give up on me

One day when nothing ever feels the same
Just like every other time before
You hit the wall and lost it all
And I'll find a way to wake you from this bed you've made
Even though I know you want me to
I'm never giving up on you

On you, on you
I'm never giving up, never giving up on you
On you, on you
I'm never giving up
I'm never giving up on you

So don't give up on me</pre></div>
