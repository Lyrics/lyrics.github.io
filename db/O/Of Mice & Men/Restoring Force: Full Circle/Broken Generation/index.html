    <div class="view"><pre>He sits and he waits, feeling broken and hollow
Hands held close to his face, screaming, "Why do I bother?"
They'll just tear me down, rip me apart
Cast aside like a sinner with no words from the wise

Will you ever learn?
Will you ever learn?
Will you ever learn
Learn to listen?

Can you hear them calling?
You'll testify to justify, you have to find a way
Can you hear them calling?
With arcane eyes you're staring back at someone with no face
Can you hear them calling?

She lies there in wait and feeling so hollow
Can't find love in this place, left alone with her sorrow
All the promises you made when you stood by her side
Were so broken when you threw it away

Will you ever learn? (Will you ever learn?)
Will you ever learn? (Will you ever learn?)
Will you ever learn? (Will you ever learn?)
Learn to listen?

Can you hear them calling?
You'll testify to justify, you have to find a way
Can you hear them calling?
We'll mobilize, not pacify to save another day
Can you pick up all the pieces of this broken generation?
Broken generation, yeah
Can you hear them calling?

The road to hell is paved in good intentions and apathy
What did you expect when common sense is your enemy?
I'd rather burn alive than drown inside your reality
Can you hear me, are you listening?

Can you hear them calling?
Testify to justify, you have to find a way
Can you hear them calling?
We'll climb the walls to scratch the sky to save another day
Can you pick up all the pieces of this broken generation?
Pick up all the pieces of this broken generation
Can you hear them calling?</pre></div>
