You took it back
How could you go and do something like that
My fingernail phase
Worst has got the best of you
I ask you and I know I need to change

(Chorus)
You took it back
You ripped my heart out of me then you put it back
I'm pulling my hair
I let you just a million times
I love you even though it isn't fair

Change
Run we go around again in circles
Play this game over again

Run we go around again in circles

(Repeat Chorus)

Run we go around again in circles
Play this game over again.

Run we go around again in circles

You took it back   (2x)

Run we go round again in circles
