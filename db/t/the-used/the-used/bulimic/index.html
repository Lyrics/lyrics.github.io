    <div class="view"><div id="lyrics">From the way that you acted to the way that I felt it,
It wasn't worth my time
And now it's sad cause all I missed wasn't that good to begin with
And now I've started you begging, saying things that you don't mean
It isn't worth my time
A line's a dime a million times
And I'm about to see all of them

Goodbye to you, goodbye to you (to you),
You're taking up my time
Goodbye to you, goodbye to you (you),
You're taking up my time
Goodbye to you, goodbye to you (to you),
You're taking up my time

You call my name when I wake up to see things go your way
I'm coughing up my time
Each drag's a drop of blood, a grain,
A minute of my life
It's all I've got just to stay down,
Why the fuck am I still down?
I'm hoarding all that's mine
Each time I let just one slip by,
I'm wasting what is mine

Goodbye to you, goodbye to you,
You're taking up my time
Goodbye to you, goodbye to you),
You're taking up my time
Goodbye to you, goodbye to you,
You're taking up my time

My time
My time
My time

I'm about to see a million things I thought I'd never see before and I
I'm about to do all the things I dreamed of and I don't even miss you at all
I'm about to see a million things I thought I'd never see before and I
I'm about to do all the things I dreamed of and I don't even miss you at all

Goodbye to you, goodbye to you,
You're taking up my time
Goodbye to you, goodbye to you,
You're taking up my time
Goodbye to you, goodbye to you,
You're taking up my time
Goodbye to you, goodbye to you,
You're taking up my time
Goodbye to you, goodbye to you,
You're taking up my time
Goodbye to you, goodbye to you,
You're taking up my time</div></div>
