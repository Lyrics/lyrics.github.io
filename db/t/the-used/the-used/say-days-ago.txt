I still remember a year ago
The times we spent
I think that I'm happier now
Up from the down
By all means
It's strange cause I feel the same way

I think of what it looks like
I think of what it tastes like
(Verse)
Same strange
Said it's strange cause I feel the same
(Repeat Verse)

Still remember what it tastes like
What it felt like

Makes me ill

I think of what it looks like
I think of what it tastes like
I think of what it looks like
I think of what it tastes, taste
(Repeat Verse x4)

Still remember what it tastes like
What it felt like
