(Chorus 1)
As we trudge along through the mud
And we tried to call it home
But we weren't alright, not at all
Not for one, for one, for one second

(Chorus 2)
Never have been one to write it down
Now I think I can
I know I'm stronger now
Who's looking south
Not me I'm not looking back
I'm done denying the truth to anyone
Cause I'm alive

(Repeat Chorus 1)

You showed me how
You seemed to find a hole
But I just laughed and smiled
Begged and rolled my eyes
Even cried and
Denied the truth to you
Just like the truth to me
Mostly lied

I'm not going to look back (x4)

White it out like glittering wax butterflies...

(Repeat Chorus 2)

I'm not going to look back (x8)
