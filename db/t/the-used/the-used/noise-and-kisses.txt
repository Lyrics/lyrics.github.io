Look in my eyes
I'm jaded now whatever that means
by sharing these things,
I rip my heart out.
it's worth my time,
whatever that means...so
hard to see up,
my neck feels stiff until I wake up.
the orange i choked
and back to my neck
it's worth my time
whatever that means...so

Share with me
Cause I need it right now
Let me see your insides
Or write me off
Cause I'd rather stop now
If you won't open up

Give it to me
Give me all...Whatever you want
It's never been me
To want this much from you
I can see
Yeah...

Share with me
Cause I need it right now
Let me see your insides
Or write me off
Cause I'd rather stop now
If you won't open up
You won't open up

(tears me up!)
(tears me up!)
(tears me up!)
(tears me up!)
