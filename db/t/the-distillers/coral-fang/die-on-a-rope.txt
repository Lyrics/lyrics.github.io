Tell me something, tell me stupid
Will I die, will I die on a rope?
Tell me something, tell me stupid
Will I die, will I die?

I wish that you didn't love me no more
I've been dead for years
I wish that you didn't own me no more
I've been here before

Tell me something, tell me stupid
Will I die, will I die on a rope?
Tell me something, tell me stupid
Will I die, will I die? No, I won't!

Tell me something, tell me stupid
Will I die, will I die on a rope?
Tell me something, tell me stupid
Will I die, will I die?

I want to draw the blood from your neck
Spill the lies in your bed
I will give you a holy white rose
Cut the tongue from your head

Tell me something, tell me stupid
Will I die, will I die on a rope?
Tell me something, tell me stupid
Will I die, will I die? No, I won't!

Tell me something, tell me stupid
Will I die, will I die on a rope?
Tell me something, tell me stupid
Will I die, will I die?

I belong to a line of red scent
Teach the heart to reflect
The wound is wise for primal black eyes
There's a scarlet letter in my chest
