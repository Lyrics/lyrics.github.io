I'm fairly local, I've been around
I've seen the streets you're walking down
I'm fairly local, good people now
Oh oh, oh oh oh, oh oh

I'm evil to the core
What I shouldn't do, I will
They say I'm emotional
What I want to save, I'll kill
Is that who I truly am?
I truly don't have a chance
Tomorrow I'll keep a beat
And repeat yesterday's dance

Yo, this song will never be on the radio
Even if my clique were to pick and the people were to vote
It's the few, the proud, and the emotional
Yo, you, bulletproof, in black like a funeral
The world around us is burning but we're so cold
It's the few, the proud, and the emotional

I'm fairly local, I've been around
I've seen the streets you're walking down
I'm fairly local, good people now
Oh oh, oh oh oh, oh oh
Oh oh, oh oh oh, oh oh

I'm not evil to the core
What I shouldn't do, I will fight
I know I'm emotional
What I want to save, I will try
I know who I truly am
I truly do have a chance
Tomorrow I'll switch the beat
To avoid yesterday's dance

Yo, this song will never be on the radio
Even if my clique were to pick and the people were to vote
It's the few, the proud, and the emotional
Yo, you, bulletproof, in black like a funeral
The world around us is burning but we're so cold
It's the few, the proud, and the emotional

I'm fairly local, I've been around
I've seen the streets you're walking down
I'm fairly local, good people now
Oh oh, oh oh oh, oh oh
Oh oh, oh oh oh, oh oh
Oh oh, oh oh oh, oh oh

I'm fairly local, I've been around
I've seen the streets you're walking down
I'm fairly local, good people now
Oh oh, oh oh oh, oh oh

Yeah, I'm fairly local, good people now
Oh oh, oh oh oh, oh oh, good people now
Oh oh, oh oh oh, oh oh, good people now
Oh oh, oh oh oh, oh oh
