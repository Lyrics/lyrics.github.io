<div><pre>We don't believe what's on TV,
Because it's what we want to see,
And what we want, we know we can't believe,
We have all learned to kill our dreams.

I need to know that when I fail you'll still be here,
'Cause if you stick around I'll sing you pretty sounds,
And we'll make money selling your hair.

I don't care what's in your hair,
I just want to know what's on your mind,
I used to say, "I want to die before I'm old, "
But because of you I might think twice.

Alright, second verse
What if my dream does not happen,
Would I just change what I've told my friends,
I don't want to know who I would be,
When I wake up from a dreamer's sleep.

I need to know that when I fail you'll still be here,
'Cause if you stick around I'll sing you pretty sounds,
And we'll make money selling your hair.

I don't care what's in your hair,
I just want to know what's on your mind,
I used to say, "I want to die before I'm old, "
But because of you I might think twice.

I don't care what's in your hair,
I just want to know what's on your mind,
I used to say, "I want to die before I'm old, "
But because of you I might think twice.

I don't care what's in your hair,
I just want to know what's on your mind,
I used to say, "I want to die before I'm old, "
But because of you I might think twice.</pre></div>
