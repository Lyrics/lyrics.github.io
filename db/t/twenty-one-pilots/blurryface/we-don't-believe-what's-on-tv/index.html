<title>Twenty One Pilots â€“ We Don't Believe What's On TV | Lyrics</title>
<meta name="description" content="We don't believe what's on TV, / Because it's what we want to see, / And what we want, we know we can't believe, / We have all learned to kill our dreams. / I need to know that when I fail you'll still be here, / 'Cause if you stick around I'll sing you pretty sounds, / And we'll make money selling your hair. / I don't care what's in your hair, / I just want to know what's on your mind, / I used to say, "I want to die before I'm old, " / But because of you I might think twice. / Alright, second verse / What if my dream does not happen, / Would I just change what I've told my friends, / I don't want to know who I would be, / When I wake up from a dreamer's sleep. / I need to know that when I fail you'll still be here, / 'Cause if you stick around I'll sing you pretty sounds, / And we'll make money selling your hair. / I don't care what's in your hair, / I just want to know what's on your mind, / I used to say, "I want to die before I'm old, " / But because of you I might think twice. / I don't care what's in your hair, / I just want to know what's on your mind, / I used to say, "I want to die before I'm old, " / But because of you I might think twice. / I don't care what's in your hair, / I just want to know what's on your mind, / I used to say, "I want to die before I'm old, " / But because of you I might think twice. / ___________________________________ / Name We Don't Believe What's On TV / Artist Twenty One Pilots / Album Blurryface"/>
