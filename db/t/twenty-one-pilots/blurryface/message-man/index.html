No no no no no no (Eh, eh, eh, eh)
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah (Eh, eh, eh, eh)

A loser hides behind a mask of my disguise
And who I am today is worse than other times
You don't know what I've done, I'm wanted and on the run
I'm wanted and on the run
So I'm taking this moment to live in the future

Release me from the present
I'm obsessin' all these questions
Why I'm in denial that they tried the suicidal session
Please use discretion when you're messin' with the message man
These lyrics aren't for everyone, only few understand

(Eh, eh, eh, eh)
(Eh, eh, eh, eh)
No no no no no no (Eh, eh, eh, eh)
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah (Eh, eh, eh, eh)

You don't know my brain the way you know my name
You don't know my heart the way you know my face
You don't know what I've done, I'm wanted and on the run
I'm wanted and on the run
So I'm taking this moment to live in the future

Release me from the present
I'm obsessin' all these questions
Why I'm in denial that they tried the suicidal session
Please use discretion when you're messin' with the message man
These lyrics aren't for everyone, only few understand

My people singing
My people singing

Hope you're dead 'cause how could you sleep at a time like this?
People, they rhyme like this, we're all impressed by this
They rip it, flip it, but these are just triplets
Wrote this in three minutes, three words to a line
It's just poetry divided, I'm the kind of guy
Who takes every moment he knows he confided in
Music to use it, for others to use it
You're dead, 'cause how could you sleep at a time like this?

Life is up here but you comment below
And the comments will always become common motivation
To promote your show's next episode
So your brain knows to keep going even though hope
Is far from this moment, but you and I know it
Gets better when morning finally rears its head
Together we're losers, remember the future
Remember the morning is when night is dead

Release me from the present
I'm obsessin' all these questions
Why I'm in denial that they tried the suicidal session
Please use discretion when you're messin' with the message man
These lyrics aren't for everyone, only few understand
Please use discretion when you're messin' with the message man
These lyrics aren't for everyone, only few understand

(Eh, eh, eh, eh)
(Eh, eh, eh, eh) My people singing
(Eh, eh, eh, eh) My people singing
(Eh, eh, eh, eh) My people singing

(Eh, eh, eh, eh)
(Eh, eh, eh, eh)</pre></div>
