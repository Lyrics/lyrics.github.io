<title>Twenty One Pilots â€“ Fairly Local | Lyrics</title>
<meta name="description" content="I'm fairly local, I've been around / I've seen the streets you're walking down / I'm fairly local, good people now / Oh oh, oh oh oh, oh oh / I'm evil to the core / What I shouldn't do, I will / They say I'm emotional / What I want to save, I'll kill / Is that who I truly am? / I truly don't have a chance / Tomorrow I'll keep a beat / And repeat yesterday's dance / Yo, this song will never be on the radio / Even if my clique were to pick and the people were to vote / It's the few, the proud, and the emotional / Yo, you, bulletproof, in black like a funeral / The world around us is burning but we're so cold / It's the few, the proud, and the emotional / I'm fairly local, I've been around / I've seen the streets you're walking down / I'm fairly local, good people now / Oh oh, oh oh oh, oh oh / Oh oh, oh oh oh, oh oh / I'm not evil to the core / What I shouldn't do, I will fight / I know I'm emotional / What I want to save, I will try / I know who I truly am / I truly do have a chance / Tomorrow I'll switch the beat / To avoid yesterday's dance / Yo, this song will never be on the radio / Even if my clique were to pick and the people were to vote / It's the few, the proud, and the emotional / Yo, you, bulletproof, in black like a funeral / The world around us is burning but we're so cold / It's the few, the proud, and the emotional / I'm fairly local, I've been around / I've seen the streets you're walking down / I'm fairly local, good people now / Oh oh, oh oh oh, oh oh / Oh oh, oh oh oh, oh oh / Oh oh, oh oh oh, oh oh / I'm fairly local, I've been around / I've seen the streets you're walking down / I'm fairly local, good people now / Oh oh, oh oh oh, oh oh / Yeah, I'm fairly local, good people now / Oh oh, oh oh oh, oh oh, good people now / Oh oh, oh oh oh, oh oh, good people now / Oh oh, oh oh oh, oh oh / __________________ / Name Fairly Local / Artist Twenty One Pilots / Album Blurryface"/>
