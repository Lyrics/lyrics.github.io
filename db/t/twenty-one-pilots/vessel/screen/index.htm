<div><pre>I do not know why I would go
In front of you and hide my soul
'Cause you're the only one who knows it
Yeah, you're the only one who knows it

And I will hide behind my pride
Don't know why I think I can lie
'Cause there's a screen on my chest
Yeah there's a screen on my chest

I'm standing in front of you
I'm standing in front of you
I'm trying to be so cool
Everything together trying to be so cool

I'm standing in front of you
Oh, I'm standing in front of you
I'm trying to be so cool
Everything together trying to be so cool

I can't see past my own nose
I'm seeing everything in slo-mo
Look out below crashing down to the ground
Just like a vertical locomotive, that's a train
Am I painting the picture that's in my brain?
A train from the sky, locomotive, my motives are insane

My flow's not great, okay
I conversate with people
Who know if I flow on a song I'll get no radio play
While you're doing fine
There's some people and I
Who have a really tough time
Getting through this life
So excuse us while we sing to the sky

I'm standing in front of you
I'm standing in front of you
I'm trying to be so cool
Everything together trying to be so cool

I'm standing in front of you
Oh, I'm standing in front of you
Oh, I'm trying to be so cool
Everything together trying to be so cool

We're broken
We're broken
We're broken
We're broken people, oh
We're broken people, oh, yeah

We're broken
We're broken
We're broken
We're broken people, oh
We're broken people, oh, yeah

We're broken
We're broken
We're broken
We're broken people, oh
We're broken people, oh, yeah

(We're broken, we're broken)
I'm standing in front of you
(We're broken, we're broken)
I'm standing in front of you
(We're broken, we're broken)
I'm trying to be so cool
(We're broken, we're broken)
Everything together trying to be so cool

(We're broken, we're broken)
I'm standing in front of you
(We're broken, we're broken)
Oh, I'm standing in front of you
(We're broken, we're broken)
Oh, I'm trying to be so cool
(We're broken, we're broken)
Everything together trying to be so cool</pre></div>
