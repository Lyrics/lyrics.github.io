    <div class="view"><pre>I wake up fine and dandy
But then by the time I find it handy
To rip my heart apart and start
Planning my crash landing
I go up, up, up, up
Up to the ceiling
Then I feel my soul start leaving
Like an old man's hair receding

I'm pleading please, oh please
On my knees repeatedly asking
Why it's got to be like this?
Is this living free?
I don't want to be the one, be the one
Who has the sun's blood on my hands, I'll tell the moon
Take this weapon forged in darkness
Some see a pen, I see a harpoon

I'll stay awake
'Cause the dark's not taking prisoners tonight

Why am I not scared in the morning?
I don't hear those voices calling
I must've kicked them out
I must've kicked them out

I swear I heard demons yelling
Those crazy words they were spelling
They told me I was gone
They told me I was gone

But I'll tell them
Why won't you let me go?
Do I threaten all your plans?
I'm insignificant
Please tell them
You have no plans for me
I will set my soul on fire
What have I become?
I'll tell them

On the eve of a day
That's forgotten and fake
As the trees, they await
And clouds anticipate
The start of a day
When we put on our face
A mask that portrays
That we don't need grace

On the eve of a day
That is bigger than us
But we open our eyes
'Cause we're told that we must
And the trees wave their arms
And the clouds try to plead
Desperately yelling
There's something we need

I'm not free
I asked forgiveness three times
Same amount that I denied
I three-time mvp'ed this crime
I'm afraid to tell you who I adore
Won't tell you what I'm sing towards
Metaphorically, I'm a whore
And that's denial number four

I'll stay awake
'Cause the dark's not taking prisoners tonight

Why am I not scared in the morning?
I don't hear those voices calling
I must've kicked them out
I must've kicked them out

I swear I heard demons yelling
Those crazy words they were spelling
They told me I was gone
They told me I was gone

But I'll tell them
Why won't you let me go?
Do I threaten all your plans?
I'm insignificant
Please tell them
You have no plans for me
I will set my soul on fire
What have I become?
I'll tell them

You have no plans for me
I will set my soul on fire
What have I become?
I'll tell them
I'll tell them
I'll tell them
I'll tell them

Please tell them
You have no plans for me
I will set my soul on fire
What have I become?
I'm sorry</pre></div>
