I can't take them on my own, my own
Oh, I'm not the one you know, you know
I have killed a man and all I know
Is I am on the run and go

Don't wanna call you in the night time
Don't wanna give you all my pieces
Don't wanna hand you all my trouble
Don't wanna give you all my demons
You'll have to watch me struggle
From several rooms away
But tonight, I'll need you to stay

Do do do do do do do do
Do do do do do do do do
Do do do do do do do do
Do do do do do do do do

Do do do do do do do do
Do do do do do do do do
Do do do do do do do do
Do

I am up against the wall, the wall
For, I hear them coming down the hall
I have killed a man and all I know
Is I am on the run and go

Don't wanna call you in the night time
Don't wanna give you all my pieces
Don't wanna hand you all my trouble
Don't wanna give you all my demons
You'll have to watch me struggle
From several rooms away
But tonight, I'll need you to stay

Do do do do do do do do
Do do do do do do do do
Do do do do do do do do
Do do do do do do do do

Do do do do do do do do
Do do do do do do do do
Do do do do do do do do
Do do do do, do, do, do, do, do, do

Cold nights under
Siege from accusations
Cerebral thunder
In one way conversations
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh

Don't wanna call you in the night time
Don't wanna give you all my pieces
Don't wanna hand you all my trouble
Don't wanna give you all my demons
You'll have to watch me struggle
From several rooms away
But tonight, I'll need you to stay

Tonight, I'll need you to stay
Tonight, I'll need you to stay
Tonight, I'll need you to stay
Tonight, I'll need you to stay
