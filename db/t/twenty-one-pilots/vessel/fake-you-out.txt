I want to drive away
In the night, headlights call my name

I, I'll never be
Be what you see inside
You say I'm not alone
But I am petrified
You say that you are close
Is close the closest star?
You just feel twice as far
You just feel twice as far

And I'll fall
And I'll break
And I'll fake
All I wanna

And I'll fall down
And I'll break down
And I'll fake you out
All I wanna

I'm so afraid
Of what you have to say
'Cause I am quiet now
And silence gives you space

I'll never be
Be what you see inside
You say I'm not alone
But I am petrified
You say that you are close
Is close the closest star?
You just feel twice as far
You just feel twice as far

And I'll fall
And I'll break
And I'll fake
All I wanna

And I'll fall down
And I'll break down
And I'll fake you out
All I wanna

It's the same game today as it always is
I don't give these places, fake my name explaining this
And the wrists of my mind have the bleeding lines
That remind me of all the times... I have committed

Dirty dirty crimes that are perfectly form-fitted
To what I've done and what I'm doing
I'm brewing and losing and spewing infusing
And believe me that's what all the kids are doing

What kids are doing, are killing themselves
They feel they have no control of their prisoner's cell
And if you're one of them, then you're one of me
And you would do almost anything just to feel free

Yeah, am I right? Of course I am
Convince me otherwise would take all night
Before you walk away, there's one more thing I want to say
Our brains are sick but that's okay

Fake you out
I'll fake you out
I'll fake you out
I'll break you down

(I'll fake you out)
And I'll fall
(And I'll fake you out)
And I'll break
(And I'll fake you out)
And I'll fake
(And I'll break you down)
All I wanna

I'll fake you out
I'll fake you out
I'll fake you out
I'll break you down

I'll fake you out
I'll fake you out
I'll fake you out
I'll break you down

All I wanna
(And I'll fake you out)
Yeah, and I'll fall down
(And I'll fake you out)
And I'll break down
(And I'll fake you out)
And I'll fake you out
(And I'll break you down)

All I wanna
(I'll fake you out)
Yeah, and I'll fall down
(And I'll fake you out)
And I'll break down
(And I'll fake you out)
And I'll fake you out
(And I'll break you down)

All I wanna

I'm so afraid
Of what you have to say
'Cause I am quiet now
And silence gives you space
