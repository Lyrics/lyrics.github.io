I don't wanna be
I don't wanna be me
I don't wanna be
Me anymore

Ever throwing at his home
Two glass houses, twenty stones
Fourteen yellow, six are blue
Could it be worse? Quite doubtful.

I don't wanna be
I don't wanna be me
I don't wanna be
Me anymore

I don't wanna be
I don't wanna be me
I don't wanna be
Me anymore

1, 2
1-2-3-4

Two steps forward, three steps back
Without warning, heart attack
He fell asleep in the snow
Never woke up, died alone

I don't wanna be
I don't wanna be me
I don't wanna be
Me anymore

I don't wanna be
I don't wanna be me
I don't wanna be
Me anymore

1, 2
1-2-3-4

Please don't dress in black
When you're at his wake
Don't go there to mourn
But to celebrate

Please don't dress in black
When you're at his wake
Don't go there to mourn
But to celebrate

I don't wanna be
I don't wanna be me
I don't wanna be
Me anymore

I don't wanna be
I don't wanna be me
I don't wanna be
Me anymore

1, 2

I don't wanna be (I don't wanna be)
I don't wanna be me (I don't wanna be me)
I don't wanna be (I don't wanna be)
Me anymore

I don't wanna be (I don't wanna be)
I don't wanna be me (I don't wanna be me)
I don't wanna be (I don't wanna be)
Me anymore
