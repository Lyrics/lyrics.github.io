Like a flash of light
In an endless night
Life is trapped between
Two black entities

'Cause when you trust someone,
Illusion has begun
No way to prepare,
Impending despair

(is there?)

Did one say so cruel:
"Tis better to love than lose"?
Ignorance is bliss
Wish not knew your kiss

So many times been burned,
This lesson goes unlearned
Remember:
desire only fuels the fire, liar, liar

Betwixed birth and death,
Every breath regrets
I pity the living,
Envy for the dead

Emotionally stunned,
In defense I'm numb
I'd rather not care
Than to be aware, be scared

I don't need love
I don't need love
I don't need love
I don't need love

Are a thousand tears
Worth a single smile?
When you give an inch,
Will they take a mile?

Longing for the past
But dreading the future
If not being used,
Well then you're a user, and a loser, ah

World renowned failure
Tt both death and life
Given nothingness,
Purgatory blight

To run and hide,
A cowardly procedure
Options exhausted,
Except for anesthesia - anesthesia

I don't feel... anything, anything
I don't feel... anything, anything
I don't feel... anything, anything
I don't feel... anything, anything

Anything, anything
No
