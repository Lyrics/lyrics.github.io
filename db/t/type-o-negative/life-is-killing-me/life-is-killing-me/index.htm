<div><pre>Like a Jew in ancient Spain
And for Christ's name
Did pay with pain
Modern day inquisition

What is the link between these crafts?
Doctors and thieves,
They both wear masks
Overpaid meat magicians

Life is killing me
Life is killing me
Life is killing me
Life is killing me

Your doctorate and PhD
Would wipe my ass
Etched in feces
Will not cure your affliction

Doctors Jeckyll or Mengele
And your face too,
They're just a blur
Can't improve my condition

Life is killing me
Life is killing me
Life is killing me
Life is killing me

Appointment made, waited three hours
Did not realize
You had such power
I'd rather see a mortician

Your parents saved or had the bucks
Your education stems from luck
Future corpse:
Death by physician

I have no choice: devoid of rights
So pull the plug, it's my damned life
Keep me alive to increase your bill
A Red Cross hell? - the hospital!

Just let me die
With dignity
It's not suicide,
Simply mercy

Just who do you think you are?
Medical school don't make you God
Now I don't care what you've been taught
Just get me off this life support

Just let me die
With dignity
It's not suicide,
Simply mercy

Life is killing me
Life is killing me
Life is killing me
Life is killing me

I said
Life is killing me
Life is killing me

I said
Life is killing me, life is killing me
Life is killing me
