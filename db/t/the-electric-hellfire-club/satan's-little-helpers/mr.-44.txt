Greetings from the gutter where the red, red rivers run
I bring you sweet salvation from the barrel of a gun
Is she a virgin or is she a whore?
I don't really give a damn

I'm Mr. 44

I'm a bottomless pit with nothing in it
A void filled with unclean spirits
A hound of Hell on a long, long leash
Can you count the number of this beast?

Mr. 44

Every time I pull my trigger the Devil's work is done
Hellfire and damnation from the barrel of a gun
22 Disciples of Hell knocking at death's door
To each his own, but make mine murder

I'm Mr. 44
