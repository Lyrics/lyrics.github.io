I found out what you did today, so run
I know where you live and I'm on my way, so run
I'll waste my life on death, so run
I want to taste your final breath, so run

Go your own way
Go your own way
(The city grieves in unison)
Go your own way

But she loves him more then anything
Crawling home on hands and knees
One day I pray that time licks these wounds clean
So smile away the last five years
Smear cascades of mascara tears

(Black, red eyes bled)
Forever

I want you to see what I've become
A hurt I would not wish on anyone
You taught us to trust no one
We are your fucked up creation

Go your own way
Go your own way
(The city grieves in unison)
Go your own way

But she loves him more then anything
Crawling home on hands and knees
One day I pray that time licks these wounds clean
So smile away the last five years
Smear cascades of mascara tears

(Black, red eyes bled)
Forever

White picket fences line these dreams they keep us out!
(Never!..)
Or do keep them in?!
(...Leave you!)
Her eyes scream pain that no one ever sees
(Deaf ears put this dull ache to sleep)
As she braces herself for the final blow
Remembering tears of not so long ago
(Everything that onces fell into place is falling apart)

And your all I have
(You've given me nothing!)
And your all I can see
(You've left me blind!)
So lets stay here together
Lets rot here together
Six feet under our love
