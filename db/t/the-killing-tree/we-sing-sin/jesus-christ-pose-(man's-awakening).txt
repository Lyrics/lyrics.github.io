Arms held out
In your Jesus Christ pose
Thorns and shroud
Like it's the coming of the Lord
And you swear to me you don't want to be my slave
But you're staring at me
Like I need to be saved

In your Jesus Christ pose

Arms held out
In your Jesus Christ pose
Thorns and shroud
Like it's the coming of the lord
And you swear to me
That you don't want to be my slave
But your staring at me
Like I'm driving the nails

Nails!

Like i'm driving the nails!

Nails!

In your Jesus Christ pose

Arms held out
Like it's the coming of the Lord
Would it pay you more to walk on water,
Then to wear a crown of thorns?
It wouldn't pain me more to bury you rich
Then to bury you poor

In your Jesus Christ pose
