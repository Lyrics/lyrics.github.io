Dead alive.
Sleep walking through these last few weeks,
and still you persist to suffocate the last
breath of life from my lungs.
Now my last thought was of you screaming my name.
The anguish in your voice as I collapse in pain.
Don't hold your breath for me, because I will let you down.
Now as I'm losing my voice, never found.
And if you get there,
don't even bother calling,
cause by the time you read this.
Instill in me your dignity.
With pride you wast another life of possibility.
Run the clock down on us.
I live in the corner you've backed me into.
And if you get there,
don't even bother calling,
cause by the time you read this,
I'll be gone.
And when I said I loved you,
I swear to god I lied.
Die motherfucker,
you and your reason why.
Am I tearing apart your life,
because you're tearing apart mine.
Now you won't see what I have made for you.
Inside I gave you everything.
Rely on me until I shatter.
Instill with me the peace you found.
And so I'm never coming back, until you're gone.
I can't save you, I can't save you.
But I want to be hopeful.
I don't know you, I don't know you, but I want to.
