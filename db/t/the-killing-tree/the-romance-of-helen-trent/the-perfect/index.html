<title>The Killing Tree â€“ The Perfect | Lyrics</title>
<meta name="description" content="I never noticed the color of your eyes / Until I saw them in the reflection of this knife. / Green with envy for a life you never had. / Bloodshot contempt when I extend my hand / (So breathe and show us what you've got underneath / clench your fists until they bleed) / See how and why I know / I don't think that this is what I want anymore / I don't care if God can save me now / Here I sit with hands cupped and head bowed / And I wonder if you're out there have you seen my name in lights? / I don't care at all / In this world of kiss & tell I've got no stories to speak of now / Silence fills this empty hole / So naive to think, that I could make you feel one thing / This excavation of my chest has produced nothing / Bow your head and pull your eyes down to see / My hand around your wrist / Turn and twist this blade deeper into me / (You can't always get what you want / but if you try sometimes you'll die on you knees) / Wait 'til the perfect comes / Until it comes / _________________ / Name The Perfect / Artist The Killing Tree / Album The Romance of Helen Trent"/>
