Reap my soul.
I whisper cruel words that
only I can hear.
I dream in a never ending line of tragedy.
Reap my soul
disposition neckbraced
by insecurity.
Let freedom
ring in my ears
painfully. And muffle this bell with the
hand of pessimism
and render it useless.


you can't stop this thought
like a passing trainwreck
it barrels through my brain, paralyzing.
In this state your words
become the daggers and I'm left bleeding.
These wounds of trust I know
as tunnel vision creates
my only sanctuary. As hope manifests
itself in the thought
of an end. A dying breath.
Reap my soul.
I'm not sure I can go on.
So drag me down
into your world.
Replace my heart
with your machine
and see if it still bleeds.

Become my enemy.

Reap my soul
My eyeslids become my enemies
I fight them to save myself
from the scene.
As the groundwork for my nightmares
is created
I stand helpless to this chaos in my head
and yet the chaos stands beautifully now
like a carefully designed city of conformity.

And I'll keep you awake tonight
and I'll hurt you
until sunrise
in this attempt to displace
this pushing attack on my senses.
Reap my soul
I'm not sure I can go on.
Now drag me down
into your world.
Replace my heart with
your machine
and see if it still bleeds
I'll cover my tracks
so you can't trace
this accident to me.

Drag me down now.
