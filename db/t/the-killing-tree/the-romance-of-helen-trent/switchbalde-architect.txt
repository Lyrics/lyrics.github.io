Switchblade feel the tempered steel
Against your skin so innocent
Orchestrate this demise and
Shut up and pay attention
Searching for an artery of
Blind affection digging for this vein
To tap dry then savor
Shut up and pay attention
Eyes wide with surpasses only by my own
So scared of the consequence

Shut up and pay attention
I want someone to listen
Now you don't believe me
How I won't let you hear a word that I said

You're all I want to know
You're all I want to hear
You don't know what you mean to me
You don't know what it means to be

Switchblade lock action into place
Quick release such a pretty face
Too late the time for taking long since passed
Shut up and pay attention
Quiet please you had your chance. now
Setting in like wet concrete
Reality begins to harden
Shut up and pay attention
