    <div class="view"><pre>Light reflects from your shadow
It is more than I thought could exist
You move through the room
Like breathing was easy
If someone believed me

They would be as in love with you as I am
They would be as in love with you as I am
They would be as in love with you as I am
They would be in love, love, love

And everyday
I am learning about you
The things that no one else sees
And the end comes too soon
Like dreaming of angels

And leaving without them

And leaving without them

Being as in love with you as I am
Being as in love with you as I am
Being as in love with you as I am
Being as in love, love, love
Love, love, love
Love, love, love

And with words unspoken
A silent devotion
I know you know what I mean

And the end is unknown
But I think I'm ready
As long as you're with me

Being as in love with you as I am
Being as in love with you as I am
Being as in love with you as I am
Being as in love, love, love</pre></div>
