<title>The xx â€“ Sunset | Lyrics</title>
<meta name="description" content="I saw you again / It felt like we had never met / It's like the sunset in your eyes / And never wanted to rise / And what have you done / With the one I love / When I look into your eyes / I see no surprise / I always thought it was sad / The way we act like strangers / After all that we had / We act like we had never met / We make believe / I've never seen your face, you neither mine / Don't catch my eye / Don't register a smile / You were more than just a friend / Oh, but the feeling / It never came to an end / I can't bear you seeing / I always thought it was a shame / That we have to play these games / It felt like you really knew me / Now it feels like you see through me / When I see you again / I'll know not to expect / Stay one step away / We won't have to wave / When I see you again / And I'm greeted as a friend / It is understood / When we did all we could / I always thought it was sad / The way we act like strangers / After all that we had / We act like we had never met / I always thought it was a shame / That we have to play these games / It felt like you really knew me / Now it feels like you see through me / ____________ / Name Sunset / Artist The xx / Album Coexist"/>
