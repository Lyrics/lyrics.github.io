We bide our time
Though the time is fine
Oh to be there
I could be there
Say you'll be there

You know the way I
Can't resist you, I
Said to myself, I'd try

Why do we waste time
Hiding it inside
I want you to be mine

Now it's been and gone
You say what you would've done
You would've been there
I wished you'd been there
I needed you there

And if we try once more
Would you give me it all?
I won't believe it
Till I can feel it
Can you feel it?

You know the way I
Can't resist you, I
Said to myself, I'd try
