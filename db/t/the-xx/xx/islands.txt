I don't have to leave anymore
What I have is right here
Spend my nights and days before
Searching the world for what's right here

Underneath and unexplored
Islands and cities I have looked
Here I saw
Something I couldn't overlook

I am yours now
So now I don't ever have to leave
I've been found out
So now I'll never explore

See what I've done?
That bridge is on fire
Back to where I've been
I'm froze by desire
No need to leave

Where would I be?
If this were to go under
That's a risk I'd take
I'm froze by desire
As if a choice I'd make

And I am yours now
So now I don't ever have to leave
I've been found out
So now I'll never explore

I am yours now (I am yours now)
So now I don't ever have to leave (ever have to leave)
I've been found out (I've been found out)
So now I'll never explore

So now I'll never explore
