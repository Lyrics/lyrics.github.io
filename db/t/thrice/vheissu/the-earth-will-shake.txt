We dream of ways to break these iron bars
We dream of black nights without moon or stars

We dream of tunnels and of sleeping guards
We dream of blackouts in the prison yard

Heartbroken we found
A gleam of hope
Harken to the sound
A whistle blows
Heaven sent reply
However small
Evidence of life
Beyond these walls

Born and bred
In this machine
Wardens dread
To see us dream
We hold tight
To legends of
Real life
The way it was before

We dream of jailers throwing down their arms
We dream of open gates and no alarms

We dream of ways to break these iron bars
We dream of black nights without moon or stars

We dream of ways to break these iron bars
We dream of black nights without moon or stars
We dream of ways to break these iron bars
We dream of black nights without moon or stars

Heartbroken we found
A gleam of hope
Harken to the sound
A whistle blows
Heaven sent reply
However small
Evidence of life
Beyond these walls

Born and bred
In this machine
Wardens dread
To see us dream
We hold tight
To legends of
Real life
The way it was before

Look to the day
The earth will shake
These weathered walls
Will fall away

Look to the day
The earth will shake
These weathered walls
Will fall away

Look to the day
The earth will shake
These weathered walls
Will fall away

Look to the day
The earth will shake
These weathered walls
Will fall away.
