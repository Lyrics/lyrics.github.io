    <div class="view"><pre>I thought I knew it all
It doesnt matter, if you believe me or not
Our hope is shattered
And any chance at love is shot

I'll take this sign to
Try and show u a way out
But once you enter
You'll know what I'm screaming about

My god what have I done?
I can feel the flames around me
As something pulls me deep into the earth

My god am I in hell?
Cuz the waters getting higher
But I cant seem to breathe
I did this to myself

Hear me out now
It's not to late for you to change
But if you don't now
You'll have only yourself to blame
I have to go now
To the place that owns my soul
I should have listened
But now it's outa my control

My god what have I done
I can feel the flames around me
As something pulls me deep into the earth

My god am I in hell
Cuz the waters getting higher
But I cant seem to breathe
I did this to myslef

My god what have I done
I can feel the flames around me
As something pulls me deep into the earth

My god am I in hell
Cuz the waters getting higher
But I cant seem to breathe
I did this to myslef

I thought I knew it all
I did this to myself
I thought I knew it all

My god what have I done
I can feel the flames around me
As something pulls me deep into the earth

My god am I in hell
Cuz the waters getting higher
But I cant seem to breathe
I did this to myslef

My god what have I done
I can feel the flames around me
As something pulls me deep into the earth

My god am I in hell
Cuz the waters getting higher
But I cant seem to breathe
I did this to myslef

Did this to myself
Oh God!</pre></div>
