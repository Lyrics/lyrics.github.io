I'm not good enough for you
I'm not seen enough for you
I'm not anything

I don't scream enough for you
I don't sing enough for you
I'm not anything

That's the way it goes when you're on top

I don't bleed enough for you
I don't see enough for you
I'm not anything

You can do you 'cause I'mma do me
And there's not a damn thing that you will achieve
You're stuck in your place

So take your best shot
Aim straight for my heart
I'm not playing this game
You can live in your shame, I don't fear anything

I don't see enough for you
I don't bleed enough for you
I'm not anything

I don't sing enough for you
I don't scream enough for you
I'm not anything

You have changed but we still stay the same

I'm not seen enough for you
I'm not good enough for you
I'm not anything

You can do you 'cause I'mma do me
And there's not a damn thing that you will achieve
You're stuck in your place

So take your best shot
Aim straight for my heart
I'm not playing this game
You can live in your shame, I don't fear anything

So take your best shot
Aim straight for my heart
I'm not playing this game
You can live in your shame, I don't fear anything

So you think you can do better
So you think you can do better
Awwwww no

So take your best shot
Aim straight for my heart
I'm not playing this game
You can live in your shame, I don't fear anything no

So take your best shot
Aim straight for my heart
I'm not playing this game
You can live in your shame, I don't fear anything no

(So you think you can do better)</pre></div>
