    <div class="view"><pre>Don't get me started on the things that I've been hearing.
You have forgotten the face of your father and now you have been disgraced.

You say I got to wear a tie to church,
and I can only get to Heaven through my works,
I hate to tell you but you're full of shit.
Earthly things mean nothing to eternal kings.

Here we go

Whoa-oh
You tell me that you love me then you say that you hate me
Whoa-oh
Well make up your mind before you drive me crazy

I bet you're gonna say this song is offensive,
a little over the top and abrasive,
if that is what it takes to wake you up,
sign me up.

You get your money so your steeple's steep,
Your flock is made up of the sick and the weak.
I hate to tell you but you're full of shit.
Earthly things mean nothing to eternal kings.

Here we go

Whoa-oh
You tell me that you love me then you say that you hate me
Whoa-oh
Well make up your mind before you drive me crazy
Whoa-oh
You tell me that you love me then you say that you hate me
Whoa-oh
Well make up your mind before you drive me crazy

I, I hate you too, I love you too
I hate you too
I love you too!
I hate you too

Here we go.

Whoa-oh
You tell me that you love me then you say that you hate me
Whoa-oh
Well make up your mind before you drive me crazy
Whoa-oh
You tell me that you love me then you say that you hate me
Whoa-oh
Well make up your mind before you drive me crazy</pre></div>
