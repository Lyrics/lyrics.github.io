Another head hangs lowly
Child is slowly taken
And the violence caused such silence
Who are we mistaken?

But you see, it's not me
It's not my family
In your head, in your head
They are fighting
With their tanks, and their bombs
And their bombs, and their guns
In your head, in your head
They are crying

In your head, in your head
Zombie, zombie, zombie-ie-ie
What's in your head?
In your head
Zombie, zombie, zombie-ie-ie-ie, oh

Doo doo doo doo doo
Doo doo doo doo doo
Doo doo doo doo doo
Doo doo doo doo doo

Another mother's breaking
Heart is taking over
When the violence causes silence
We must be mistaken

It's the same old theme
Since 1916
In your head, in your head
They're still fighting
With their tanks, and their bombs
And their bombs, and their guns
In your head, in your head
They are dying

In your head, in your head
Zombie, zombie, zombie-ie-ie
What's in your head?
In your head
Zombie, zombie, zombie-ie-ie-ie
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, ay-oh, yah yah ow
