Benedict, can I get a smash sex course
Six pack slash drum edge
No tone, they're faceless, the mix on sticks
Ibiza's rotten encrusted rocks
Transmit, transmit (transmit)

What's he fuckin' doing?
What's he fuckin' doing? (Laugh!)
What's he fuckin' doing?
What's he fuckin' doing?

Plug it in, pre-mixed, all bought it
It's all about the gear
Bleached-hair wanking mates just flown in on the lear
Private-jet, personal flyer
All done it, all fucking dire
Straights eight quid a packet?
Fuck that, I'm on the bacci mate (transmit)

What's he fuckin' doing?
What's he fuckin' doing? (Laugh!)
What's he fuckin' doing?
What's he fuckin' doing?

(Eject the alarms off)
Cause the music, you're so darn dull
(Eject the alarms off)
Cause the music, all darn dull
Stare

Cause the music, you're so darn dull
(Eject the alarms off)
Cause the music, all darn dull
