If you believe the western sun is falling down on everyone
If you're breaking free and the morning's come
If you would know your time has come
If you believe the western sun is falling down on everyone
If you're feeling firm, then I'll travel on
If you feel it burn, your time has come

And I feel it
You feel another energy and I feel a power growing
You feel another energy and I feel a power grow
You feel another energy and I feel a power grow

If you believe the western sun is falling down on everyone
If you're breaking free and the morning's come
If you would know your time has come
If you believe the western sun is falling down on everyone
And you feel it burn, don't try to run
And you feel it burn, your time has come
I feel it!
You feel another energy and I feel a power growing
You feel another energy and I feel a power grow
You feel another energy and I feel a power grow

Om Namah Narayana
Om Namah Narayana
Om Namah Narayana
Om Namah Narayana
Om Namah Narayana

I feel it
I feel it
You feel another energy...
