Every moment can't remain
And every life won't stay the same
With time comes a layer of rust
And our bones will turn to dust
Everyone will fall away
And every season is built on change
With time, the paint will peel
And all sense will lose its feel
Every cloth will start to fray
And every night will become day
With time, a mold will form
And what's cold can become warm
Every love can't always stay
And the dead will soon decay
With time, we'll all be gone
But how you lived can live on

Every moment can't remain
And every life won't stay the same
With time comes a layer of rust
And our bones will turn to dust
Everyone will fall away
And every season is built on change
With time, the paint will peel
And all sense will lose its feel
Every cloth will start to fray
And every night will become day
With time, a mold will form
And what's cold can become warm
Every love can't always stay
And the dead will soon decay
With time, we'll all be gone
But how you lived can live on
