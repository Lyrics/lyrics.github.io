Over and under
I'll dissolve and use charm as my cover
Left over right
Walk a careful line between you and the outside

There is confidence and delusion
I reside between that confusion
It's a misstep down a black hole
It's a long way down and a mouthful

So overcome and become one
So over...

Over and under
We learn to grow and we learn to recover
Over and out
I'll play the card that holds me in less doubt

There's promiscuity and devotion
And only one fulfills an emotion
It's a big step to end a yearning
It's accepting love but I'm learning

To overcome and become one
So overcome and become one

I'll find my way
And follow through
And maybe there
I'll find my way
And follow through
And maybe there
I'll find my way
And follow through
And maybe there I'll meet you
