It's not for nothing, but I've seen a transformation
Like I consider my happiness for the first time in ages
And you might say I'm off, but it's the first time I'm feeling on

Don't worry, I still get dizzy in the usual situations

And most people I know, I've used as camouflage
I've circled myself with pretty people to hide who I was
And I won't miss them and they won't miss me

I'll tie in those loose ends
A string is just the thread to separation
And I'll retire these old clothes
To brace for a wardrobe that no one knows

Don't worry, I still get dizzy in the usual situations
But it's those instances I have used to ground me on occasion
Don't worry, I still get dizzy in the usual situations
