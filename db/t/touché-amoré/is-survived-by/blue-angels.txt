Since you're so curious
Well it's anything really
Call it my witching hour
Or what calls to me
But to be serious
Well, it's worse than you think
Should I be ashamed
Because of what I need?

Define right and wrong
In regard to what's going on

Take two
Slip away till the afternoon
It's an easy remedy
For what I just can't do

Over the counter and over the moon
I have my beliefs
This has me confused
But what can I do?

I feel relief in just watching you breathe
It's hypnotizing like an inner peace
I get fixated on your deepest breath
Waiting for the angels to take their effect
