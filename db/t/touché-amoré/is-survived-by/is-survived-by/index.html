    <div class="view"><pre>It's a song of thanks sung by a hack
When the reflection of yourself just won't look back
It's that panic you feel when you don't know what to say
When everyone wants in and you want the subject to change
Because I've been swallowed up and I've been split in two
And I'm not sure which is me and who I respond through

So notify my next of kin
And let them know there's so much more to believe in
It doesn't have to be based on blood
Because the next in line shouldn't have to know what they're made of

This is survived by who held me up
This is survived by who sang the song
And that sense of purpose has made it all worth it

So write a song that everyone can sing along to
So when you're gone, you can live on, they won't forget you

This is survived by a love
This is survived by a cause
That you aren't the only who remembers what it was

This is survived by a love
This is survived by a wish
That you won't let down who has attached themselves to it

This is survived by a love
This is survived by a fear
That all that's left when said and done is words you will never ever hear</pre></div>
