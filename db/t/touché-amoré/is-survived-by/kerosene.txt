It's the early signs of disintegration
The back and forth from a new machine
It's been blessed and burned into a formation
By a wish dipped in kerosene

So who's gonna light the fuse?
Who's going to be the one
To hold high the flame
Because I refuse

And I've just begun
So don't hold me down, I'm almost done
A lesson lived through the loss of love
This is not a search for who's at fault
It's more of a plea for hope and understanding

It's the side effects of adoration
The come and go and get out clean
I've been cursed and freed from dedication
By a wish dipped in kerosene

So who's gonna light the fuse?
Who's gonna be the one
Because I refuse

And I've just begun
So don't hold me down, I'm almost done
A lesson lived through the loss of love
This is not a search for who's at fault
It's more of a plea for hope and understanding
