<title>Touché Amoré – To Write Content | Lyrics</title>
<meta name="description" content="You can call this coming clean / Or the repeat of what you know / About the struggles I once had / As I'm learning to let go / I made a pledge to myself / If I was to raise my voice / To be direct as I can be / No matter what I may destroy / But I can't say I haven't aged / I've outgrown what I used to be / I won't fake what is expected / To succeed with album three (That's not me) / Does this mean that the words won't come? / Does this mean that I'm at my end? / If my joy comes with the price of my love / I won't pay if I have to pretend / There's always a chance to relapse and fall back / To the person I still fear is there / So if this ink will suddenly run out / I'll refill if I feel the need to share / It was the fall of last year in New York City / Day two of a tour, when my friend Johnny said / "Hey, I'd like you to meet Andy" / We got to talking and connected on some things / Mutual friends and how his band started writing / But then something was spoke / I knew exactly what he meant / I understood when he said / "It's hard to write content" / And it still is, and it still is / But I won't take a step back / Though it might be for the best / And it still is, and it still is / I know you asked for some advice / They use your blood to capitalize / So give up all your secrets / To move units, display your weakness / You might spend some years alone / At the price of forgetting your home / So expose what hurts you the worst / The exchange deals a handsome return (Are you in?) / ______________________ / Name To Write Content / Artist Touché Amoré / Album Is Survived By"/>
