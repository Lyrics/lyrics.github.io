Don't ask me why
Have you ever wondered why I always drive alone?
Same reasons why I never pick up my phone
I got these issues that you can't subscribe
And I'm scared to talk to anyone for what they might prescribe

These days I just try to keep to myself
Well aware I've lost touch with everyone else
I understand that I'm fading away
I'd rather play dead than play catch up
Because no one really cares all that much
I can't keep having the same conversations
I look to the floor to keep concentration
Focused hard on every single word
My nails are dug deep and my stomach hurts
I am selfish it seems, but I'm trying my best to breathe
Hoping you don't notice as I keep laughing
