With intermission ending, the finale is approaching
It's not what you're expecting, there is no magic involved
Now will you take your seats, and be quiet please
I need all eyes on me, as I try to explain:
This is my final act so may I have your full attention
And for my final trick I'll make everyone who loves me disappear
But I won't know how to bring them back
Alone I'll stand on this stage
No one to care, myself to blame
An act with no conclusion
That's me up there
That's me: repetition
