You said I'm always on the go
How nice of you to notice
A toast to all those broken homes
Everyone I know is a fortress
I kiss ellipsis
A fork in all my one way roads
I just sit to see what happens
But apathy is easy for me
So I'll accept this challenge
I don't know how to get myself up
Your pressure is bending my crutch
If this thing breaks, it's the end of us both
But I like the sound of that
