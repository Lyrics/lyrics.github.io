My girlfriend's a dick magnet
My girlfriend gotta have it
She's hot, can't stop, up on stage, doing shots
Tip the man he'll ring the bell, get her drunk she'll scream like hell

Dirty girl, getting down, dance with guys from outta town
Grab her ass, acting tough, mess with her, she'll fuck you up
No one really knows if she's drunk or if she's stoned
But she's coming back to my place tonight

She likes to shake her ass, she grinds it to the beat
She likes to pull my hair when I make her grind her teeth
I like to strip her down, she's naughty to the end
You know what she is, no doubt about it
She's a bad, bad girlfriend

Red thong, party's on, love this song, sing along
Come together, leave alone, see you later back at home
No one really knows if she's drunk or if she's stoned
But she's coming back to my place tonight
I say, no one really knows just how far she's gonna go
But I'm gonna find out later tonight

She likes to shake her ass, she grinds it to the beat
She likes to pull my hair when I make her grind her teeth
I like to strip her down, she's naughty to the end
You know what she is, no doubt about it
She's a bad, bad girlfriend

Doesn't take her long to make things right
But does it make her wrong to have the time of her life?
The time of her life
My girlfriend's a dick magnet
My girlfriend gotta have it

She's a gold digger, now you figure out it's over, pull the trigger
Future's finished, there it went, savings gone, the money spent
I look around and all I see, no good, bad and ugly
Man she's hot and fixed to be, the future ex-Miss Connolly

She likes to shake her ass, she grinds it to the beat
She likes to pull my hair when I make her grind her teeth
I like to strip her down, she's naughty to the end
You know what she is, no doubt about it
She's a bad, bad girlfriend

She's a bad, bad girlfriend
She's a bad, bad girlfriend
