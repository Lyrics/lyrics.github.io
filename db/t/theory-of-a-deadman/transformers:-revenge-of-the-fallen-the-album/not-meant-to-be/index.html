    <div class="view"><div id="lyrics">It's never enough to say I'm sorry
It's never enough to say I care
But I'm caught between what you wanted from me
And knowing if I give that to ya I might just disappear

Nobody wins when everyone's losing

It's like one step forward and two steps back
No matter what I do you're always mad
And I, I can't change your mind

It's like trying to turn around on a one way street
I can't give you what you want and it's killing me
And I, I'm starting to see
Maybe we're not meant to be

It's never enough to say I love you
No it's never enough to say I try
It's hard to believe, that there's no way out for you and me
And it seems to be, the story of our life

Nobody wins when everyone's losing

It's like one step forward and two steps back
No matter what I do you're always mad
And I, I can't change your mind

It's like trying to turn around on a one way street
I can't give you what you want and it's killing me
And I, I'm starting to see
Maybe we're not meant to be

There's still time to turn this around
Should we be building this up instead of tearing it down
But I keep thinking maybe it's too late

It's like one step forward and two steps back
No matter what I do you're always mad
And I, I can't change your mind

It's like trying to turn around on a one way street
I can't give you what you want and it's killing me
And I, I finally see
Baby we're not meant to be

It's like one step forward and two steps back
No matter what I do you're always mad
And I'm, baby I'm sorry to see
Maybe we're not meant to be</div></div>
