With malice they have to pray all the night
The lunatic priests are pouring their lectures
So cruel and so evil the mastery's right
it was a necromancy of unknowing preachers
lascivious lashes slave-trade in Kareyth
It was a forcing the style when the reverends pray
It's idolatry at night this place forces to die
So the force of religion corrodes in Kareyth

Now hanging in Kareyth
Now hanging in Kareyth

It's the spasm of anguish in Kareyth's slaves' eyes
Neuralpathics are victims of the priests' seduction
It's a place of too sinful a suffering the source of all plights
It was a necromancy of unknowing preachers
It's the stronghold of malice and insanity and pride
So the fatal attraction forced suicide
It's the babylon of russia this cruel dammed foul Kareyth
The evil dispersed its polluted light

Now hanging in Kareyth
