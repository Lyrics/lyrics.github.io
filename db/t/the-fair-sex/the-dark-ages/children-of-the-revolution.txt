Yeah

Well you can bump and grind
If it's good for your mind
Well you can twist and shout
Let it all hang out

But you won't fool
The children of the revolution
No, you won't fool
The children of the revolution

No, no, no

Well you can terraplane
In the falling rain
I drive a Rolls Royce
'Cos it's good for my voice

But you won't fool
The children of the revolution
No, you won't fool
The children of the revolution

But you won't fool
The children of the revolution
No, you won't fool
The children of the revolution

No, you won't fool
The children of the revolution
No, you won't fool
The children of the revolution

No, no, no

But you won't fool
The children of the revolution
No, you won't fool
The children of the revolution

No, you won't fool
The children of the revolution
No, you won't fool
The children of the revolution
No, you won't fool
The children of the revolution

No, no, no
