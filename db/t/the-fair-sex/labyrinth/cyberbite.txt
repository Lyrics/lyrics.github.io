Living can be easy on someting you can trust,
The more you watch the less you know,
Let your worries be our task
A new world breaks and we've got what it takes

Cyberbite you tricky liar,
Contorded truth casting system
With televictims whose heads are being filled with ooze,
Mindless willing tools

Cyberbite stole my soul
Cyberbite stole my soul
Cyberbite stole my soul

Cyberbyte the system creeping in control,
Random is resistance, freedom is the goal
Cyberbite
Cyberbite

Cyberbyte the system creeping in control,
Random is resistance, freedom is the goal
Cyberbite
Cyberbite

Televicious coma media in control filling empty eyes,
Flooding emptied minds
Who failed the trial

Giving up the ego
They're crawling to the beast
Cyberbite's the new religion shaping us to its mould
It's time to counteract
Cyberbyte the system

Cyberbite stole my soul
Cyberbite stole my soul
Cyberbite stole my soul

Cyberbyte the system creeping in control,
Random is resistance, freedom is the goal
Cyberbite
Cyberbite

Cyberbyte the system creeping in control,
Random is resistance, freedom is the goal
Cyberbite
Cyberbite

Cyberbyte the system creeping in control,
Random is resistance, freedom is the goal
Cyberbite
Cyberbite
