<div><pre>(lifts us up, lifts us up, lifts us up)
Let me hear you sing it
(lifts us up, lifts us up, lifts us up)
So when the last light fades
Shine on
Shine on young love
you hold my hands
and I'll hold yours
then life won't feel so wrong
I know you're hurting like I am
I know your heart's in your hands
we share a life so bleak
with broken memories
Shine on
Shine on young love
you lit the fires in my heart
and I won't give that up
So shine on (Shine on)
Shine on young love
You know we're all sinking together
but this lifts us up
(lifts us up, lifts us up, lifts us up)
Let me hear you sing it
(lifts us up, lifts us up, lifts us up)
So let the last light fade
Shine on
Shine on young love
We'll burn these fires bright
lets blaze our past into the night
Because it's been too long
and we have been too down
so now it's sink or swim
and we're too strong to drown
Shine on
Shine on young love
You lit the fires in my heart
and I won't give that up
So shine on (Shine on)
Shine on young love
You know we're all sinking together
but this lifts us up
I've felt as helpless as you
Felt the will to give in
Let your heart open up
Let the healing begin
Find your way to the light
and fight the will to give in
It's sink or swim
and we're too strong to drown
It's sink or swim
and we're too strong to drown
We'll take our time
and make a change
This is our chance to sail away
We'll take our time
and make a change
This is our chance
So let the last light fade
Shine on
Shine on young love
You lit the fires in my heart
and I won't give that up
So shine on
Shine on young love
You know we're all sinking together
but this lifts us up
Shine on
(lifts us up)
You lit the fires in my heart
and I won't give that up
So shine on
(lifts us up)
You know we're all sinking together
but this lifts us up</pre></div>
