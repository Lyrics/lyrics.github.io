<title>The Amity Affliction â€“ Chasing Ghosts | Lyrics</title>
<meta name="description" content="Will they remember my name when I'm gone? / When they know what I did was so fucking wrong? / Put the steel to my wrist - lost the breath in my chest, / just to forget all the wrongs I had left. / I took the exit, left my friends in the gutter; / left my life right behind me - left myself, left it all, / left myself, left it all, / not a falter not a stutter, not a note and now? / There's nothing at all. / Are you at all haunted by memories past? / Are you ready to make this one breath your last? / Is your chest so heavy you're ready to leave, / or are you just hoping that someone will grieve? / And now we roll on... I'm gone now, / I don't remember much, I just know that I would have been better off / if i had stayed, spoken to a friend, / let my heart keep on beating and not given it all up for the grave. / There's no one there on the other side, / there's nothing more than what I had. / There's no ghost left to haunt you, so you know I'm still here, / just the end of my life nothing left here at all. / There's no memories here, just the regrets of the dead. / Please don't follow my footsteps- cherish all you have left. / Are you at all haunted by memories past? / Are you ready to make this one breath your last? / Is your chest so heavy you're ready to leave, / or are you just hoping that someone will grieve? / There's no one there on the other side, / (there's no one there on the other side) / There's nothing more than what I had. / There's no ghost left to haunt you. / There's no ghost. / There's no memories here, just the regrets of the dead, / please don't follow in my footsteps - cherish all you have left. / There's no memories here / Just the regrets of the dead / Please don't follow in my footsteps - cherish all you have left. / Are you at all haunted by memories past? / Are you ready to make this one breath your last? / Is your chest so heavy you're ready to leave, / or are you just hoping that someone will grieve? / Are you at all haunted by memories past? / Are you ready to make this one breath your last? / Is your chest so heavy you're ready to leave, / or are you just hoping that someone will grieve? / ____________________ / Name Chasing Ghosts / Artist The Amity Affliction / Album Chasing Ghosts"/>
