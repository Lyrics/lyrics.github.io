    <div class="view"><div id="lyrics">I've been searching for an exit, but I'm lost inside my head
Where I spend every waking moment wishing I was dead
For a few minutes get me away from here
For a few minutes wipe away my tears
For I am lost right now as the ocean deep
I am low my friend and how my heart does sink
Yeah I am lost right now as the ocean deep
I am low my friend and how my heart does sink

It's like there's cancer in my blood
It's like there's water in my lungs
And I can't take another step
Please tell me I am not undone
It's like there's fire in my skin
And I'm drowning from within
I can't take another breath
Please tell me I am not undone

I've been searching for an exit but I'm lost inside my head
Where I spend every waking moment wishing this would end
I can't take another step, I cannot live inside my mind
I can't face another day, I am so fucking tired
For I am lost right now as the ocean deep
I am low my friend and how my heart does sink
Yeah I am lost right now as the ocean deep
I am low my friend and how my heart does sink

It's like there's cancer in my blood
It's like there's water in my lungs
And I can't take another step
Please tell me I am not undone
It's like there's fire in my skin
And I'm drowning from within
I can't take another breath
Please tell me I am not undone

I've been searching for an exit but I'm lost inside my head
Where I spend every waking moment, wishing I was dead
I'll take another step for you
I'll shed my tears until I drown, or until I am underground
I'll take another breath for you...
Will you still be there when I'm home, out from the great unknown?

It's like there's cancer in my blood
It's like there's water in my lungs
And I can't take another step
Please tell me I am not undone
It's like there's fire in my skin
And I'm drowning from within
I can't take another breath
Please tell me I am not undone</div></div>
