<title>The Amity Affliction â€“ Pittsburgh - No Intro | Lyrics</title>
<meta name="description" content="I've been searching for an exit, but I'm lost inside my head / Where I spend every waking moment wishing I was dead / For a few minutes get me away from here / For a few minutes wipe away my tears / For I am lost right now as the ocean deep / I am low my friend and how my heart does sink / Yeah I am lost right now as the ocean deep / I am low my friend and how my heart does sink / It's like there's cancer in my blood / It's like there's water in my lungs / And I can't take another step / Please tell me I am not undone / It's like there's fire in my skin / And I'm drowning from within / I can't take another breath / Please tell me I am not undone / I've been searching for an exit but I'm lost inside my head / Where I spend every waking moment wishing this would end / I can't take another step, I cannot live inside my mind / I can't face another day, I am so fucking tired / For I am lost right now as the ocean deep / I am low my friend and how my heart does sink / Yeah I am lost right now as the ocean deep / I am low my friend and how my heart does sink / It's like there's cancer in my blood / It's like there's water in my lungs / And I can't take another step / Please tell me I am not undone / It's like there's fire in my skin / And I'm drowning from within / I can't take another breath / Please tell me I am not undone / I've been searching for an exit but I'm lost inside my head / Where I spend every waking moment, wishing I was dead / I'll take another step for you / I'll shed my tears until I drown, or until I am underground / I'll take another breath for you... / Will you still be there when I'm home, out from the great unknown? / It's like there's cancer in my blood / It's like there's water in my lungs / And I can't take another step / Please tell me I am not undone / It's like there's fire in my skin / And I'm drowning from within / I can't take another breath / Please tell me I am not undone / ___________________________ / Name Pittsburgh - No Intro / Artist The Amity Affliction / Album Let The Ocean Take Me"/>
