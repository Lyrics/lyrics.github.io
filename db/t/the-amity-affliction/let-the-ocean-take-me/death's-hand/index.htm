<div><pre>I held death's hand this evening

Can't keep my heart from beating
Can't keep my throat from screaming
There has to be another way for me to keep on living

I held death's hand this evening
Closed my eyes now I'm dreaming
I promise I won't leave here
Don't let me die I'm fucking screaming

'Cause I've got more life left to live (got some promises to keep)
To all the hearts that carried me (up from the ocean deep)
I've had to do some searching to understand our reasons
For every selfish feeling (I held death's hand this evening)

Now my lungs are failing
And my heart is fading
My mind is taking me
So far away I'm dreaming
For every selfish reason
I kept the bottles rolling
I poured my heart out
To stop you from leaving

I held death's hand this evening
Closed my eyes now I'm dreaming
I promise I won't leave here
Don't let me die I'm fucking screaming

'Cause I've got more life left to live (got some promises to keep)
To all the hearts that carried me (up from the ocean deep)
I've had to do some searching to understand our reasons
For every selfish feeling (I held death's hand this evening)

You're the ones that kept me going
I owe you this much
You gave me the strength to say
"Hey, Death, get fucked!"

You're the ones that kept me going
I owe you this much
You gave me the strength to say
"Hey, Death, get fucked!"

Now my lungs are failing
And my heart is fading
My mind is taking me
So far away I'm dreaming
Now my lungs are failing
And my heart is fading
My mind is taking me...</pre></div>
