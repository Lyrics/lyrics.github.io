    <div class="view"><pre>It's not the way you smile that touched my heart,
It's not the way you kiss that tears me apart.
Many many, many nights go by
I sit alone at home and cry over you.
What can I do?
Don't want nobody, nobody,
'Cause baby, it's you.
Baby, it's you.

Is it true what they say about you?
They say you never ever, ever been true.

It doesn't matter what they say,
I know I'm gonna love you any old way
What can I do about you?
Don't want nobody, nobody,
'Cause baby, it's you.
Baby, it's you.

Baby!
Oh!
Baby!

It doesn't matter what they say,
I know I'm gonna love you any old way
What can I do without you?
Don't want nobody, nobody.
Baby, it's you.
Baby, it's you.

Don't leave me all alone
Baby, come on home
Baby, it's you
Baby baby, it's you

You know I need your love, babe
Oh, baby, come home
Oh baby, it's you</pre></div>
