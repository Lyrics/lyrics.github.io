Spanish songs in Andalucia
The shooting sites in the days of '39
Oh please leave the vendanna open
Federico Lorca is dead and gone

Bullet holes in the cemetery walls
The black cars of Guardia Civil
Spanish bombs on the Costa Rica
I'm flying in on a DC-10 tonight

Spanish bombs, yo te quiero infinito
Yo te acuerda, oh mi corazón
Spanish bombs, yo te quiero infinito
Yo te acuerda, oh mi corazón

Spanish weeks in my disco casino
The freedom fighters died up on the hill
They sang The Red Flag, they wore the black one
After they died it was mockingbird hill

Back home the buses went up in flashes
The Irish tomb is drenched in blood
Spanish bombs shatter the hotels
My señoritas rose was nipped in the bud

Spanish bombs, yo te quiero infinito
Yo te acuerda, oh mi corazón
Spanish bombs, yo te quiero infinito
Yo te acuerda, oh mi corazón

The hillsides ring with "Free the people"
Or can I hear the echoes from the days of '39?
Trenches full of poets, a ragged army
Fixing bayonets to fight the other line

Spanish bombs rock the province
I'm hearing music from another time
Spanish bombs, Costa Brava
I'm flying in on a DC-10 tonight

Spanish bombs, yo te quiero infinito
Yo te acuerda, oh mi corazón
Spanish bombs, yo te quiero infinito
Yo te acuerda, oh mi corazón

Spanish songs in Andalucía, Mandolina
Oh mi corazón
Spanish songs in Granada
Oh mi corazón
