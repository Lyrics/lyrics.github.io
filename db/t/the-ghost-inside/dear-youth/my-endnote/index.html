This is what I'll take back.</p><p>We won't compete. I won't fight for a throne that doesn't exist.<br/>We won't compete. Everything we have is lost through arrogance.<br/>We won't compete. I won't fight for a throne that doesn't exist.<br/>We won't compete. It's only us who feel the consequence.</p><p>I choose to start today because I'm longing for a life less plagued.<br/>Where we both know, that if we both go, then we leave behind an empty page.</p><p>Why would I fight a war when I've lost everything I'm fighting for?<br/>Why do you turn your head when together we could wake the dead?</p><p>This is not beyond repair.<br/>This is a certainty. This is a must for me.<br/>Because it's not beyond repair.</p><p>We won't compete. I won't fight for a throne that doesn't exist.<br/>We won't compete. Everything we have is lost through arrogance.<br/>We won't compete. I won't fight for a throne that doesn't exist.<br/>We won't compete. It's only us who feel the consequence.</p><p>You can't break me.<br/>I have taken the stand and I have earned my place.<br/>Those who breed disgrace remain faceless.</p><p>With my head held high, I'll give until I am gone. You can't break me.<br/>With my head held high, I've been here all along. You can't break me.</p></article></div>
