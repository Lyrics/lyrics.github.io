Consider this my endnote to be read when I'm gone.
I have always been looking for this, dying for this, but It seems I've lost track.
This is everything I believed in. This is what I'll take back.

We won't compete. I won't fight for a throne that doesn't exist.
We won't compete. Everything we have is lost through arrogance.
We won't compete. I won't fight for a throne that doesn't exist.
We won't compete. It's only us who feel the consequence.

I choose to start today because I'm longing for a life less plagued.
Where we both know, that if we both go, then we leave behind an empty page.

Why would I fight a war when I've lost everything I'm fighting for?
Why do you turn your head when together we could wake the dead?

This is not beyond repair.
This is a certainty. This is a must for me.
Because it's not beyond repair.

We won't compete. I won't fight for a throne that doesn't exist.
We won't compete. Everything we have is lost through arrogance.
We won't compete. I won't fight for a throne that doesn't exist.
We won't compete. It's only us who feel the consequence.

You can't break me.
I have taken the stand and I have earned my place.
Those who breed disgrace remain faceless.

With my head held high, I'll give until I am gone. You can't break me.
With my head held high, I've been here all along. You can't break me.
