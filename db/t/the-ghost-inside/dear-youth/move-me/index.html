It's the end to all my means.</p><p>Constantly incomplete.</p><p>With my back against the wall, I stack brick by brick.<br/>I will rise above them all like this.</p><p>I may not be forgiven, but I forgave and I'll forget.<br/>Going through the motions is no way to exist.<br/>So if there's anybody out there that's so sick of feeling alone,<br/>Has the damage already been done? You gotta get from underneath that gun.</p><p>We walk before we run.</p><p>With my back against the wall, I stack brick by brick.<br/>I will rise above them all like this.</p><p>Move me, choose me. Please before you lose me.<br/>Find me, drive me. End the things that pride me.<br/>Move me, improve me. Ignite the flame that ruled me.<br/>Guide me, collide me. I need something to survive me.</p><p>With my back against the wall. I will rise above them all like this.<br/>Coming back against all odds, I stack brick by brick. I will rise above them all like this.</p></article></div>
