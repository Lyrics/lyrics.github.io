    <div class="view"><pre>I leave behind this sentiment to the man that I'll become.
Telling him not to be burdened by the things that I have done.
The longest days and endless nights have become the routine.
Far beyond frustration. It's the end to all my means.

Constantly incomplete.

With my back against the wall, I stack brick by brick.
I will rise above them all like this.

I may not be forgiven, but I forgave and I'll forget.
Going through the motions is no way to exist.
So if there's anybody out there that's so sick of feeling alone,
Has the damage already been done? You gotta get from underneath that gun.

We walk before we run.

With my back against the wall, I stack brick by brick.
I will rise above them all like this.

Move me, choose me. Please before you lose me.
Find me, drive me. End the things that pride me.
Move me, improve me. Ignite the flame that ruled me.
Guide me, collide me. I need something to survive me.

With my back against the wall. I will rise above them all like this.
Coming back against all odds, I stack brick by brick. I will rise above them all like this.</pre></div>
