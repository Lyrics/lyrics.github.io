    <div class="view"><article id="lyrics"><p>This is not a dream cause I am not asleep.<br/>I'll need more than a metaphor if I want to earn my keep.<br/>My head is in clouds. My feet are on the ground. Even if I fall I'll always stand proud.</p><p>I'll carry my weight where brave dare go.<br/>Through sleet, through rain, I'll trail courses unknown.<br/>I'll carry my weight making sand out of stone.<br/>I'll blaze this trail alone and take the long road.</p><p>Day in, day out, your heart's growing colder.<br/>Your prying hands can't lift that chip off your shoulder.<br/>Fade in, fade out, you fight with apathy.<br/>Don't cloud my vision when you're the one who can't see.</p><p>I'll carry my weight where brave dare go.<br/>Through sleet, through rain, I'll trail courses unknown.<br/>I'll carry my weight making sand out of stone.<br/>I'll blaze this trail alone and take the long way home.</p><p>I was always talking to myself because nobody would stick around.<br/>Developed my own language and now I'm the loudest in the crowd.<br/>(Now I have to) ask myself why they wanna stick around?<br/>It's funny how they lift you up before they put you in the ground.</p><p>Remember those things we were all meant to fear.<br/>And laugh as we realize they all got us here.<br/>I am the one. Unfortunate sun.<br/>My death made a mark while your lives faded away.</p><p>I'll carry my weight where brave dare go.<br/>Through sleet, through rain, I'll trail courses unknown.<br/>I'll carry my weight making sand out of stone.<br/>I'll blaze this trail alone and take the long way home.</p><p>I find strength where others find defeat. My eyes are open as I push on.<br/>I used to always feel alone, but now I know I'm not the only one.</p></article></div>
