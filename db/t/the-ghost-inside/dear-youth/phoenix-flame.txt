Breathe in, breathe out. Breathe.

I'll never be what you think I should be. No, not today.
I'll never say all the things I should say. I'm only human.

More often than not, you're gonna feel alone.
It's a long fall from the top. Can you stand it?
Gave it all that I've got everywhere I roamed.
I can't do this alone, can you help me?

This is how it ends. We fall, we mend.
Burn and start again. Rebuild, forget.
Lest we forget.

Breathe in, breathe out.
