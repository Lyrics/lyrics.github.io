<div><pre>It appears that we can't rely on common sense.
Let's act our age and turn the page on this intolerance.
Because we're not meant to live like this. By-products of ignorance.

This is out of control, it's out of control, it's gotta go. You're scared of what you don't know.
I'll say this over again, and over again, until it ends. A house divided will never stand.

Always failing to be accepting cause hatred stems from uncertainty.
Speaking down from above casts a shadow on the ones in search of the sun.
You think you're better than me? Your words of "wisdom" are spreading disease.
But you won't get the better of me. Walk in these shoes before you trample my feet.

This is out of control, it's out of control, it's gotta go. You're scared of what you don't know.
I'll say this over again, and over again, until it ends. A house divided will never stand.

We tear each other down to build ourselves up. A system failure, enough is enough.
"Cause in a world this shaky and unstable, we've got to be less fucking hateful."
Knuckles white. This is beyond aggression.
Knuckles white. Because we need new direction.

This is out of control, it's out of control, it's gotta go. You're scared of what you don't know.
I'll say this over again, and over again, until it ends. A house divided will never stand.
This is out of control, it's out of control, it's gotta go. You're scared of what you don't know.
I'll say this over again, and over again, until it ends. A house divided will never stand.

This is out of control. I'll say this over again.
A house divided will never stand.</pre></div>
