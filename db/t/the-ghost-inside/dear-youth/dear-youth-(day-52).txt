The second hand looks like a knife. As it's counting down the rest of our lives.
So hard to swallow. No steps to follow. It became so hard to survive.

Dear youth, what was your one big plan?
You made us believe we had the world in our hands.
We left home with nowhere to go. Facing our fears as we brave the unknown.

All I have to keep are these jaded old memories from screams of how it used be.
I once was blind but now I can see that words of rationality were wasted on me.

So I said goodbye. It's just a memory, that hasn't come to be.
But I recognize that if you're on the right track but catch the wrong train,
Nothing ends the same.

Dear youth, what was your one big plan?
You made us believe we had the world in our hands.
We left home with nowhere to go. Facing our fears as we brave the unknown.

Dear youth, put back those thoughts in my head.
The ones where I believe that I am boundless again.
I know we're at the end of the road. This is our story, this was our home.

We were unbreakable.

Alive and well. The days are shrinking.
Alive and well. Each moment more fleeting.
Alive and well. We gave our best.
Alive. And well, you know the rest...;
