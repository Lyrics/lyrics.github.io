This is not a dream cause I am not asleep.
I'll need more than a metaphor if I want to earn my keep.
My head is in clouds. My feet are on the ground. Even if I fall I'll always stand proud.

I'll carry my weight where brave dare go.
Through sleet, through rain, I'll trail courses unknown.
I'll carry my weight making sand out of stone.
I'll blaze this trail alone and take the long road.

Day in, day out, your heart's growing colder.
Your prying hands can't lift that chip off your shoulder.
Fade in, fade out, you fight with apathy.
Don't cloud my vision when you're the one who can't see.

I'll carry my weight where brave dare go.
Through sleet, through rain, I'll trail courses unknown.
I'll carry my weight making sand out of stone.
I'll blaze this trail alone and take the long way home.

I was always talking to myself because nobody would stick around.
Developed my own language and now I'm the loudest in the crowd.
(Now I have to) ask myself why they wanna stick around?
It's funny how they lift you up before they put you in the ground.

Remember those things we were all meant to fear.
And laugh as we realize they all got us here.
I am the one. Unfortunate sun.
My death made a mark while your lives faded away.

I'll carry my weight where brave dare go.
Through sleet, through rain, I'll trail courses unknown.
I'll carry my weight making sand out of stone.
I'll blaze this trail alone and take the long way home.

I find strength where others find defeat. My eyes are open as I push on.
I used to always feel alone, but now I know I'm not the only one.
