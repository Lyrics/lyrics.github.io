<title>The Ghost Inside â€“ Mercy | Lyrics</title>
<meta name="description" content="For whom the bell tolls. / There's a hurricane raging inside me. The second wave is right there behind me. / Don't leave me alone, as this fire burns whole. Before there's nothing left to atone. / Breathe new life into me. Send waves to crash right through me. / I wear the perfect disguise, right behind my eyes. / Its got me coming undone. / My facade made of stone. I'm deep beneath now, I need to let go. / This life has taken it's toll. I can't be myself pleasing everyone else. No! / First one up in line when there is hell to pay. Filthy hands that never wash away. / This is one time I won't being subjective. / I need to see things from a brand new perspective. / Because I'm coming undone. / My facade made of stone. I'm deep beneath, now I need to let go. / This life has taken it's toll. I can't be myself pleasing everyone else. No! / I'd like to think I'd never cave in. A vicious battle I may never win. / And I'd like to think I'll come out stronger. Life's swinging hard but I'm swinging harder. / For whom the bell tolls. / "I have an inheritance from my father, it's the moon and the sun. / And although that I roam all over the world, the spending's never done." / My facade made of stone. I'm deep beneath, now I need to let go. / This life has taken it's toll. I can't be myself pleasing everyone else. No! / ___________ / Name Mercy / Artist The Ghost Inside / Album Dear Youth"/>
