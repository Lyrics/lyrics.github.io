Can't give in, and shut down.<br/>Just breathe in and breathe out and begin.<br/>I shook the hand of doubt so I could sever the lines that he spits from his mouth.<br/>And now it's time to pull through. Something I must do with or without you.</p><p>I've been here one time, two times, now three times before.<br/>Long enough not to wait around for that knock upon my door.<br/>I'm staring at the face of doubt so I can't forget who I'm cutting out.<br/>Why put in my all just to watch my buildings fall?</p><p>Hey, hey, I'm living for today.<br/>Forgetting things I can't change unwinds me.<br/>Hey, hey, nothing stands in my way.<br/>Time stopped when I broke the chains that bound me.</p><p>It all comes down to this. Both truth and consequence.<br/>I need something more than an empty promise.<br/>To believe in something, just one thing, that will never go wrong, not today.<br/>Letdown after letdown, I'm done.</p><p>Hey, hey, I'm living for today.<br/>Forgetting things I can't change unwinds me.<br/>Hey, hey, nothing stands in my way.<br/>Time stopped when I broke the chains that bound me.</p><p>Count the clock till the overhaul.<br/>You built a bomb inside my walls.<br/>Count the clock till we're out of hand.<br/>You build, build now we're caught in the avalanche.</p><p>Reset, rebuild. You wrecked this city but not my will.</p></article></div>
