I suffer just to run with the wolves.</p><p>So I sing these words to the fortunate. The ones who look alive.<br/>Never living life in disconnect, through someone else's eyes.</p><p>Whoa, I can't find my way.<br/>There's no path to guide me. The more I give in, the more it haunts me.<br/>And I like a fool, am burned. I give and give with no return.</p><p>Whoa, there's no path to guide me. The more I give in, the more it haunts me.<br/>And I've given up control. I suffer just to run with the wolves.</p><p>Nothing will be earned by skipping stones.<br/>Lessons won't be learned through broken bones.<br/>One by one, we're losing ourselves.<br/>Like a flame burning out, but I have a light.<br/>When you're in the dark and out of doubt, find me.</p><p>God, what have I done?<br/>I've lost myself for no one.</p><p>Whoa, I can't find my way.<br/>There's no path to guide me.
