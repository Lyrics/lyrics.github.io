A passing phase.<br/>Moving forward? Not today!<br/>The limit's in the sky, but will you be reaching it tonight?</p><p>Tonight you got to test the limits and tell yourself that.<br/>"I'm alive!" Just make that choice and draw that line tonight.<br/>Tonight you got to test the limits and tell yourself that,<br/>"I'm alive, and I'm not going anywhere!"</p><p>No chance to be free. No chance to soar in the sky.<br/>Your feet fixed to the ground.<br/>Desperation is what's weighing you down.<br/>Whether my strength be heaven sent or my own self-confidence.<br/>These days when I'm walking through a crowd.<br/>I don't have to hold my head down.</p><p>No more wasting time. Burn bright like a star, ignite.<br/>The limit's in the sky but will you be reaching it tonight?</p><p>Tonight you got to test the limits and tell yourself that.<br/>"I'm alive!" Just make that choice and draw that line tonight.<br/>Tonight you got to test the limits and tell yourself that,<br/>"I'm alive, and I'm not going anywhere!"</p><p>"Be a leader and never ever follow"<br/>That's what my father, that's what he always told me.<br/>So with those words boldly spoken, he sent me down a long and hard road.</p><p>Shrug it off my shoulders, it was never meant for me.<br/>I won't waste my time in mediocrity.</p><p>Tonight I'm alive.</p></article></div>
