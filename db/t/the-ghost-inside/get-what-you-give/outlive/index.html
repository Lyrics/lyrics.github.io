<title>The Ghost Inside â€“ Outlive | Lyrics</title>
<meta name="description" content="We're so disconnected but not misdirected. / They think that we are nothing, but I believe in something more. / You watch the clock wind down and let the days go by. / You justify the time you've spent, but all you do is make the rent. / We'll be buried with our memories, you'll just be dead. / I'll live forever, you'll just die in vain. / No home, no bed. Nowhere to hang my head. / At the end of the day I hear no words they say. / No home, no bed. Nowhere to hang my head. / I don't care what they say; I made a choice for me. / We're so disconnected but not misdirected. / So quick in passing judgment like I don't belong. / We'll be buried with our memories, you'll just be dead. / I'll live forever, you'll just die in vain. / No home, no bed. Nowhere to hang my head. / At the end of the day I hear no words they say. / No home, no bed. Nowhere to hang my head. / I don't care what they say; I made the choice for me. / But this time, I stand for this. / There's no space between the lines. / I stand for this. / No compromise this time. / I stand for this. / _____________ / Name Outlive / Artist The Ghost Inside / Album Get What You Give"/>
