<title>The Ghost Inside â€“ Dark Horse | Lyrics</title>
<meta name="description" content="True dedication most just do not posses / When push becomes shove, can you rise above the rest? / Waves of words, they fall short and crash at my feet / Such are the ways of the weak. / "I'm not scared!" It's all that I know / Done nothing but travel without knowing where to go / I've been digging up bones / Remnants of what made up me that I've never shown. / This is my time to rise. / Dark horse. I'll fight my way to the top. / You will never be the thorn in my side / Dark horse. Dreams are my driving force / Open your eyes. Go live your own life. / "I'm not scared!" It's all that I know / Done nothing but travel without knowing where to go / I've been digging up bones / Remnants of what made up me that I've never shown. / When the smoke clears, and the damage is done. / I'll be the only one left standing / I see someone without a shred of hope / At their breaking point. At the end of the rope. / "I'm not scared!" It's all that I know / Done nothing but travel without knowing where to go / I've been digging up bones / Remnants of what made up me that I'll never show. / ________________ / Name Dark Horse / Artist The Ghost Inside / Album Get What You Give"/>
