<title>The Ghost Inside â€“ White Light | Lyrics</title>
<meta name="description" content="You left some hope instilled in me / That I never should give up on anything / I know this made you proud of me / So this song remains for those who hurt like me. / The man in black. He rides alone to a final destination unknown. / The man in black. He rides alone: he's moving on. Not coming home. / I used to be the fearless one. / Living each day like death would never come / Now I feel his cold breath on my neck / He's watching my steps and telling me that I could be next. / Before I used to take these wings and I'd fly so high / (I'd fly so high. I tried.) / Now I live in regret never coming down to say goodbye / Oh why can't I? / The man in black. He rides alone to a final destination unknown. / The man in black. He rides alone: he's moving on. / I can't follow. / I used to be the fearless one. / Living each day like death would never come / Now I feel his cold breath on my neck / He's watching my steps and telling me that I could be next. / So make way for the man in black / So make way. He's never coming back. / I am so lost at sea / Ryan, shine the light for me / I'm sinking, I can't swim / I need you here to pull me in / I am so lost at sea / Ryan, shine your light for me / I'm sinking, I can't swim / I miss you brother. / You will never dim. / _________________ / Name White Light / Artist The Ghost Inside / Album Get What You Give"/>
