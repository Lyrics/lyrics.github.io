You left some hope instilled in me
That I never should give up on anything
I know this made you proud of me
So this song remains for those who hurt like me.

The man in black. He rides alone to a final destination unknown.
The man in black. He rides alone: he's moving on. Not coming home.

I used to be the fearless one.
Living each day like death would never come
Now I feel his cold breath on my neck
He's watching my steps and telling me that I could be next.

Before I used to take these wings and I'd fly so high
(I'd fly so high. I tried.)
Now I live in regret never coming down to say goodbye
Oh why can't I?

The man in black. He rides alone to a final destination unknown.
The man in black. He rides alone: he's moving on.
I can't follow.

I used to be the fearless one.
Living each day like death would never come
Now I feel his cold breath on my neck
He's watching my steps and telling me that I could be next.

So make way for the man in black
So make way. He's never coming back.

I am so lost at sea
Ryan, shine the light for me
I'm sinking, I can't swim
I need you here to pull me in
I am so lost at sea
Ryan, shine your light for me
I'm sinking, I can't swim
I miss you brother.
You will never dim.
