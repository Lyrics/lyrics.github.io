<div><pre>I was lead to believe, but now I know for sure.
When the wind's knocked out of me.
Only one thing that can be cure and bring me to my feet.
When all the words just relate.
I just hit play, and when the record comes to an end.
I'll listen all over again.

Truth is, I'm taking a step back and taking some time to think.
I've just got to express myself with this pen and ink.
Because I've got something left to say.
This means all the world to me. These words never let me down.

This all made me who I am. This is how I became a man.
So when breath escapes and my eyes close.
Just hit play and when the record comes to an end.
I'll sing all over again.

Truth is, I'm taking a step back and taking some time to think.
I've just got an express myself with this pen and ink.
Because I've got something left to say.
This means all the world to me. These words never let me down.

This is my everything. Come do your worst, this is my obsession.
I chose this life, and I've found m own direction.

Truth is, I'm taking a step back and taking some time to think.
I've just got an express myself with this pen and ink.
Because I've got something left to say.
This means all the world to me. These words never let me down.

When this record comes to an end, I'll just start it all over again.</pre></div>
