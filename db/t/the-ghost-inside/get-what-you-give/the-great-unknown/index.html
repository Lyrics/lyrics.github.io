<title>The Ghost Inside â€“ The Great Unknown | Lyrics</title>
<meta name="description" content="Sometimes we get so low / Downsides are all we see / Your world is swallowed whole / And now you're all alone waiting for me / I put my faith in the ones / I trust to stick it out / Who never tuck their tail and run / That's what friendship's all about. / I'm sick of waiting for my life to come to me / So I singing "I'm not waiting" / You want to know how this all has come to be? / Because I lean on the ones beside me / Go and do what makes you happy / That's what I'm saying / I'm done waiting for my life to come to me / So I'm headed into the great unknown / And I'm not going alone. / Cast aside left to fend for yourself your back is to the sun / Repeat your words over again "I don't need anyone" / In a world that wants nothing more than to break me down / I can take on anything with my true friends around / You could never hold me down. / I'm sick of waiting for my life to come to me / So I'm singing "I'm not waiting" / You want to know how this all has come to be? / Because I lean on the ones beside me / Go and do what makes you happy / That's what I'm saying / I'm done waiting for my life to come to me / So I'm headed into the great unknown. / I put my faith in the tried and true / It's just you and me with nothing to lose / Keep those you trust right by your side / Only the strong will survive. / I put my faith in the tried and true / It's just you and me with nothing to lose / I have the strong ones by my side / It's what's keeping me alive. / _______________________ / Name The Great Unknown / Artist The Ghost Inside / Album Get What You Give"/>
