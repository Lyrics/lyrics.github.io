We look up to the sky, I swear it never ends.
Walk down the road on any path we choose.
But then something changed, now days just aren't the same.
I'm feeling so empty like part of me has been removed.

My youth is getting older. It got left out in the bitter cold.
Now I put it on the back burner where it doesn't belong.
Where did I go wrong?

Let me stop to ask the question, "Will I ever get the chance to repeat?"
I feel this more and more everyday. Take me back to when I used to believe.

Nothing could prepare you, but we try our best.
Failure upon failure, what happens next?
Nothing's ever easy and life still goes on.
Don't stop push on before you become withdrawn. I've become withdrawn.

My youth is getting older. It got left out in the bitter cold.
Now I put it on the back burner where it doesn't belong.
Where did I go wrong?

My innocence is gone. Where did I go wrong?
I feel it slipping away from me. Do you remember when we were free?

I've stood up on that ledge, and I know what you see:
You're looking over the edge and wanting to leap.
I've written every word and expressed all my concerns.
You're losing that part of yourself, but it wasn't meant to be.

My youth is getting older. It got left out in the bitter cold.
Now I put it on the back burner where it doesn't belong.
Where did I go wrong? My innocence is gone.
