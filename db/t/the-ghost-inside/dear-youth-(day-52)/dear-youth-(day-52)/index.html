It became so hard to survive.</p><p>Dear youth, what was your one big plan?<br/>You made us believe we had the world in our hands.<br/>We left home with nowhere to go. Facing our fears as we brave the unknown.</p><p>All I have to keep are these jaded old memories from screams of how it used be.<br/>I once was blind but now I can see that words of rationality were wasted on me.</p><p>So I said goodbye. It's just a memory, that hasn't come to be.<br/>But I recognize that if you're on the right track but catch the wrong train,<br/>Nothing ends the same.</p><p>Dear youth, what was your one big plan?<br/>You made us believe we had the world in our hands.<br/>We left home with nowhere to go. Facing our fears as we brave the unknown.</p><p>Dear youth, put back those thoughts in my head.<br/>The ones where I believe that I am boundless again.<br/>I know we're at the end of the road. This is our story, this was our home.</p><p>We were unbreakable.</p><p>Alive and well. The days are shrinking.<br/>Alive and well. Each moment more fleeting.<br/>Alive and well. We gave our best.<br/>Alive. And well, you know the rest...;</p></article></div>
