Don't let me walk out the door
Don't let me know what it's for
Don't let me know what it's for
Don't let me walk out the door
Don't let me walk out the door
Don't let me know what it's for
Don't let me know what it's for
You look solid

Can't say i'll be there right now
Can't say i'll be there somehow
Can't say i'll be there right now
And you've been waiting for so long

I got my eyes on you now
I got my eyes on the prize
I got my eyes on you now
And i've been waiting for so long

The lies they to are scared of you
The way we are right from the start
Yeah you owe me
Yeah you owe me
I don't do you to call that's true
Off you to fall to rip from the love
Yeah you owe me
Yeah you owe me

Don't let me walk out the door
Don't let me walk out the door
Don't let me know what it's for
Don't let me know what it's for
Cause i've been waiting for so long

I don't do you to call that's true
Off you to fall to rip from the love
Yeah you owe me
Yeah you owe me

A calf an are why do you stare
The life the love down from above
Yeah you owe me
Yeah you owe me
Yeah you owe me
Yeah you owe me
Yeah you owe me
Yeah you owe me

And ties are prize
And my ally
And ties are prize
And my ally for you</pre></div>
