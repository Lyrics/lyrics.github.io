<title>Thom Yorke â€“ Black Swan | Lyrics</title>
<meta name="description" content="What will grow crooked you can't make straight / It's the price that you gotta pay / Do yourself a favor and pack your bags / Buy a ticket and get on the train / Buy a ticket and get on the train / 'Cause this is fucked up, fucked up / 'Cause this is fucked up, fucked up / People get crushed like biscuit crumbs / And laid down in the bitumen / You have tried your best to please everyone / But it just isn't happening / No, it just isn't happening / And it is fucked up, fucked up / Well this is fucked up, fucked up / This is your blind spot, blind spot / It should be obvious, but it's not / You cannot kickstart a dead horse / You just cross yourself and walk away / I don't care what the future holds / 'Cause I'm right here and I'm today / With your fingers you can touch me / I am your black swan, black swan / (But I made it to the top, but I made it to the top) / This is fucked up, fucked up / (I'm a baby in the dust, I'm a baby in the dust) / We are black swans, black swans / (But I made it to the top, but I made it to the top) / And for spare parts we're broken up / (I'm a baby in the dust, I'm a baby in the dust) / You are fucked up, fucked up / This is fucked up, fucked up / We are black swans, black swans / And for spare parts we're broken up / ________________ / Name Black Swan / Artist Thom Yorke / Album Late Night Tales: The Cinematic Orchestra"/>
