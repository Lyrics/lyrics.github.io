I'm getting edgy all the time
There's someone around me just a step behind
It's kinda scary the shape I'm in
The walls are shaking and they're closing in

Too fast or a bit too slow
I'm paranoid of people and it's starting to show
One guy that I can't shake
Over my shoulder, is a big mistake

Sitting on the bed and I'm lying wide awake
There's demons in my head and it's more than I can take
I think I'm on a roll but I think it's kinda weak
Saying all I know is, I gotta get away from me

I tell you something just ain't right
My head is on loose but my shoes are tight
Avoiding my friends, they all bug
Life is like a riddle and I'm really stumped

If you reason, don't you know
Your own preoccupation is where you'll go
I'm being followed, I look around
It's only my shadow creeping on the ground

Sitting on the bed and I'm lying wide awake
There's demons in my head and it's more than I can take
I think I'm on a roll but I think it's kinda weak
Saying all I know is, I gotta get away from me

Gotta get away from me
Gotta get away from me

Whoa-oah-oah
Whoa-oah-oah
Whoa-oah-oah
Whoa-oah-oah

Sitting on the bed and I'm lying wide awake
There's demons in my head and it's more than I can take
I think I'm on a roll but I think it's kinda weak
Saying all I know is, I gotta get away from me

Gotta get away from me
Gotta get away from me
Gotta get away from me
