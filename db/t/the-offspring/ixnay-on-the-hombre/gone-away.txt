Maybe in another life
I could find you there
Pulled away before your time
I can't deal it's so unfair

And it feels
And it feels like
Heaven is so far away
And it feels
Yeah, it feels like
The world has grown cold
Now that you've gone away

Leaving flowers on your grave
Show that I still care
But black roses and Hail Marys
Can't bring back what's taken from me

I reach to the sky
And call out your name
And if I could trade
I would

And it feels
And it feels like
Heaven is so far away
And it stings
Yeah, it stings now
The world is so cold
Now that you've gone away

Gone away
Gone away
Yeah yeah, yeah yeah yeah
Ooh
Yeah ooh-ooh
Gone away

I'll save your soul
Woah, yeah

I reach to the sky
And call out your name
Oh please, let me trade
I would

And it feels
And it feels like
Heaven is so far away
And it feels
Yeah, it feels like
The world has grown cold
Now that you've gone away

Gone away
Gone away
Yeah, yeah yeah yeah yeah
Ooh
Yeah ooh-ooh
Gone away

Yeah ooh
Yeah ooh-ooh
Gone away
