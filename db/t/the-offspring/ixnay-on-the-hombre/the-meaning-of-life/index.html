<title>The Offspring â€“ The Meaning of Life | Lyrics</title>
<meta name="description" content="On the way / Trying to get where I'd like to stay / I'm always feeling steered away / By someone trying to tell me / What to say and do / I don't want it / I gotta go find my own way / I gotta go make my own mistakes / Sorry man for feeling / Feeling the way I do / Oh yeah, oh yeah / Open wide and they'll shove in their meaning of life / Oh yeah, oh yeah / But not for me, I'll do it on my own / Oh yeah, oh yeah / Open wide and swallow their meaning of life / I can't make it work your way / Thanks but no thanks / By the way / I know your path has been tried and so / It may seem like the way to go / Me, I'd rather be found / Trying something new / And the bottom line / In all of this seems to say / There's no right and no wrong way / Sorry if I don't feel like / Living the way you do / Oh yeah, oh yeah / Open wide and they'll shove in their meaning of life / Oh yeah, oh yeah / But not for me, I'll do it on my own / Oh yeah, oh yeah / Open wide and swallow their meaning of life / I can't make it work your way / Thanks but no thanks / Oh yeah, oh yeah / Open wide and they'll shove in their meaning of life / Oh yeah, oh yeah / But not for me, I'll do it on my own / Oh yeah, oh yeah / Open wide and swallow their meaning of life / I can't make it work your way / Thanks but no thanks / _________________________ / Name The Meaning of Life / Artist The Offspring / Album Ixnay On The Hombre"/>
