    <div class="view"><pre>On the way
Trying to get where I'd like to stay
I'm always feeling steered away
By someone trying to tell me
What to say and do

I don't want it
I gotta go find my own way
I gotta go make my own mistakes
Sorry man for feeling
Feeling the way I do

Oh yeah, oh yeah
Open wide and they'll shove in their meaning of life
Oh yeah, oh yeah
But not for me, I'll do it on my own
Oh yeah, oh yeah
Open wide and swallow their meaning of life
I can't make it work your way
Thanks but no thanks

By the way
I know your path has been tried and so
It may seem like the way to go
Me, I'd rather be found
Trying something new

And the bottom line
In all of this seems to say
There's no right and no wrong way
Sorry if I don't feel like
Living the way you do

Oh yeah, oh yeah
Open wide and they'll shove in their meaning of life
Oh yeah, oh yeah
But not for me, I'll do it on my own
Oh yeah, oh yeah
Open wide and swallow their meaning of life
I can't make it work your way
Thanks but no thanks

Oh yeah, oh yeah
Open wide and they'll shove in their meaning of life
Oh yeah, oh yeah
But not for me, I'll do it on my own
Oh yeah, oh yeah
Open wide and swallow their meaning of life
I can't make it work your way
Thanks but no thanks</pre></div>
