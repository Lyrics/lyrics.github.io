(Okay)
Ya ya ya ya ya

Day after day your home life's a wreck
The powers that be just breathe down your neck
You get no respect, you get no relief
You gotta speak up and yell out your piece

So back off your rules, back off your jive
'Cause I'm sick of not living to stay alive
Leave me alone, not asking a lot
I don't wanna to be controlled

That's all I want
That's all I want
That's all I want
That's all I want

Ya ya ya ya ya

How many times is it gonna take
'Til someone around you hears what you say
You've tried being cool, you feel like a lie
You've played by their rules, now it's their turn to try

So back off your rules, back off your jive
'Cause I'm sick of not living to stay alive
Leave me alone, not asking a lot
I just don't wanna to be controlled

That's all I want
That's all I want
That's all I want
That's all I want

I said it before, I'll say it again
If you could just listen then it might make sense

So back off your rules, back off your jive
'Cause I'm sick of not living to stay alive
Leave me alone, not asking a lot
Just don't wanna to be controlled

That's all I want
That's all I want
That's all I want
Ya ya ya ya ya
