<title>Thirty Seconds To Mars â€“ The Kill | Lyrics</title>
<meta name="description" content="What if I wanted to break? / Laugh it all off in your face? / What would you do? / What if I fell to the floor? / Couldn't take all this anymore? / What would you do, do, do? / Come, break me down / Bury me, bury me / I am finished with you / What if I wanted to fight? / Beg for the rest of my life? / What would you do? / You say you wanted more / What are you waiting for? / I'm not running from you (From you) / Come, break me down / Bury me, bury me / I am finished with you / Look in my eyes / You're killin' me, killin' me / All I wanted was you / I tried to be someone else / But nothing seemed to change, I know now / This is who I really am inside / Finally found myself / Fightin' for a chance, I know now / This is who I really am / Come, break me down / Bury me, bury me / I am finished with you, you, you / Look in my eyes / You're killin' me, killin' me / All I wanted was you / Come, break me down (Bury me, bury me) / Break me down (Bury me, bury me) / Break me down (Bury me, bury me) / (You say you wanted more) / What if I wanted to break? / (What are you waiting for?) / (Bury me, bury me) / (I'm not running from you) / What if I, what if I / What if I, what if I... / (Bury me, bury me) / ______________ / Name The Kill / Artist Thirty Seconds To Mars / Album A Beautiful Lie"/>
