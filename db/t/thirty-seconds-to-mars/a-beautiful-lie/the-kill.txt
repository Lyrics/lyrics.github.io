What if I wanted to break?
Laugh it all off in your face?
What would you do?
What if I fell to the floor?
Couldn't take all this anymore?
What would you do, do, do?

Come, break me down
Bury me, bury me
I am finished with you

What if I wanted to fight?
Beg for the rest of my life?
What would you do?
You say you wanted more
What are you waiting for?
I'm not running from you (From you)

Come, break me down
Bury me, bury me
I am finished with you
Look in my eyes
You're killin' me, killin' me
All I wanted was you

I tried to be someone else
But nothing seemed to change, I know now
This is who I really am inside
Finally found myself
Fightin' for a chance, I know now
This is who I really am

Come, break me down
Bury me, bury me
I am finished with you, you, you
Look in my eyes
You're killin' me, killin' me
All I wanted was you

Come, break me down (Bury me, bury me)
Break me down (Bury me, bury me)
Break me down (Bury me, bury me)

(You say you wanted more)
What if I wanted to break?
(What are you waiting for?)
(Bury me, bury me)
(I'm not running from you)
What if I, what if I
What if I, what if I...
(Bury me, bury me)
