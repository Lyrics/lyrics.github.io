Surrender to nothing, or give up what I
Started and stopped it, from end to beginning

Run away, run away, I'll attack
Run away, run away, go chase yourself
Run away, run away now, I'll attack
I'll attack, I'll a-
WHOAAAA

I would've kept you forever, but we had to sever
It ended for both of us, faster than a
Kill off this thinking, it's starting to sink in
I'm losing control now, but without you I can finally see

Run away, run away, I'll attack

Run away, run away (I'll attack), I will attack
Run away, run away (I'll attack), I will attack
Run away (I'll attack), run away now, I'll attack
I'll attack, I'll a-
WHOAAAA

Your promises

I promise you
I promise you
