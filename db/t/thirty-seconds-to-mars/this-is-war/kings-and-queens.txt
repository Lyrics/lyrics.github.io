(Oh, oh, oh)
(Oh, oh, oh)
(Oh, oh, oh)
(Oh, oh, oh)

Into the night
Desperate and broken
The sound of a fight
Father has spoken

(Oh, oh, oh)
(Oh, oh, oh)

We were the kings and queens of promise
We were the victims of ourselves
Maybe the children of a lesser God
Between Heaven and Hell, Heaven and Hell

Into your eyes
Hopeless and taken
We stole our new lives
Through blood and name

In defense of our dreams
In defense of our dreams
(Dreams, dreams, dreams)

We were the kings and queens of promise
We were the victims of ourselves
Maybe the children of a lesser God
Between Heaven and Hell, Heaven and Hell

The age of man is over
A darkness comes at dawn
These lessons that we've learned here
Have only just begun

We were the kings and queens of promise
We were the victims of ourselves
Maybe the children of a lesser God
Between Heaven and Hell

We are the kings
(Oh, oh, oh)
We are the queens
(Oh, oh, oh)
We are the kings
(Oh, oh, oh)
We are the queens
(Oh, oh, oh)
(Oh, oh, oh)
(Oh, oh, oh)
(Oh, oh, oh)
