I don't remember the moment I tried to forget
I lost myself, is it better not said?
Now I'm closer to the edge

It was a thousand to one and a million to two
Time to go down in flames and I'm taking you
Closer to the edge

No I'm not saying I'm sorry
One day, maybe we'll meet again
No I'm not saying I'm sorry
One day, maybe we'll meet again
No, no, no, no

Can you imagine a time when the truth ran free?
The birth of a song, the death of a dream
Closer to the edge

This never ending story, paid for with pride and fate
We all fall short of glory
Lost in ourselves

No I'm not saying I'm sorry
One day, maybe we'll meet again
No I'm not saying I'm sorry
One day, maybe we'll meet again
No, no, no, no

No, no, no, no, I will never forget
No, no, I will never regret
No, no, I will live my life

No, no, no, no, I will never forget
No, no, I will never regret
No, no, I will live my life

No I'm not saying I'm sorry
One day, maybe we'll meet again
No, no
No I'm not saying I'm sorry
One day, maybe we'll meet again
No, no, no, no

Closer to the edge
Closer to the edge (no, no, no, no)
Closer to the edge
Closer to the edge (no, no, no, no)
Closer to the edge
