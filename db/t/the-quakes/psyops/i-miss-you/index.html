<title>The Quakes â€“ I Miss You | Lyrics</title>
<meta name="description" content="I see your face in such a lonely place, / But you're a million miles away. / I've got your photograph and you've got mine, / We said we'd meet again someday. / I won't forget you, / And I won't let you fade away. / I'll run beside you. / I may decide to stay. / What place and forces in the universe / Are responsible for this? / I was rejected, when we connected, / And you sealed it with your kiss. / I won't defy you, / I'll be right by you all the way. / Sometimes it's hard to find the words, / The words to say... / I miss you, I miss you / More and more each day. / I miss you, I miss you / More than I can say. / I see your face in such a lonely place, / But you're a million miles away. / I've got your photograph and you've got mine, / We said we'd meet again someday. / I won't forget you, / And I won't let you fade away. / I'll run beside you. / I may decide to stay. / Go away / I miss you, I miss you / More and more each day. / I miss you, I miss you / More than I can say. / Our friends think we're crazy, / We live so far away. / But baby, don't you listen, / Don't you listen to what they say. / I miss you, I miss you / More and more each day. / I miss you, I miss you / More than I can say. / I miss you, I miss you / More and more each day. / I miss you, I miss you / More than I can say. / Okay / ________________ / Name I Miss You / Artist The Quakes / Album Psyops"/>
