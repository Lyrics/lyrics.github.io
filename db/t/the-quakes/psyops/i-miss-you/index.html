    <div class="view"><pre>I see your face in such a lonely place,
But you're a million miles away.
I've got your photograph and you've got mine,
We said we'd meet again someday.

I won't forget you,
And I won't let you fade away.
I'll run beside you.
I may decide to stay.

What place and forces in the universe
Are responsible for this?
I was rejected, when we connected,
And you sealed it with your kiss.

I won't defy you,
I'll be right by you all the way.
Sometimes it's hard to find the words,
The words to say...

I miss you, I miss you
More and more each day.
I miss you, I miss you
More than I can say.

I see your face in such a lonely place,
But you're a million miles away.
I've got your photograph and you've got mine,
We said we'd meet again someday.

I won't forget you,
And I won't let you fade away.
I'll run beside you.
I may decide to stay.

Go away

I miss you, I miss you
More and more each day.
I miss you, I miss you
More than I can say.

Our friends think we're crazy,
We live so far away.
But baby, don't you listen,
Don't you listen to what they say.

I miss you, I miss you
More and more each day.
I miss you, I miss you
More than I can say.

I miss you, I miss you
More and more each day.
I miss you, I miss you
More than I can say.

Okay</pre></div>
