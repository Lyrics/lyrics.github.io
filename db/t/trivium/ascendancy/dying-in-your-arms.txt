I'm wearing thin, wearing out, becoming weak
Holding hands with this rope
She's my self-destructive bleeding disease
The things that makes it hard to breathe
But if I shoved you far away
This addict just starved again, asphyxiated

And now I see it's you that's tearing me
Ensnaring me
This is me dying in your arms
I cut you out; now set me free

Lynched high above what used to be
In her gallows built for me
So I escaped; cut this noose around my neck

I break free to see the things you blinded me
And I shoved you far away
Now I live the life I dreamed of
You're dead to me

And now I see it's you that's tearing me
Ensnaring me
This is me dying in your arms
I cut you out; now set me free

You poisoned my life
So I take this knife
And I cut you out
Cut you out

And now I see it's you that's tearing me
Ensnaring me
This is me dying in your arms
I cut you out; now set me free

Set me free...set me free
