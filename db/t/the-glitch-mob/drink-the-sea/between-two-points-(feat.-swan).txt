We've got forever
Slippin' through our hands
We've got more time
To never understand

Falling footsteps
Weighing heavy on me

Behind darkness
Beneath candles
Whispers waltz
Around our dreams

The shortest distance
Between two points
Is the line
From me to you

Feet turning black
Is this the path we must walk
No turning back
Wish i could just hear you talk

Can something like this be pulled
From under our feet
Leaving our skin
And burning coals to meet

Tell me now

The shortest distance
Between two points
Is the line
From me to you

The shortest distance
Between two points
Is the line
From me to you
Me to you
