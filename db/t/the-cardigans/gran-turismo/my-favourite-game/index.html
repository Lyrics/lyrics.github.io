<title>The Cardigans â€“ My Favourite Game | Lyrics</title>
<meta name="description" content="I don't know what you're looking for / You haven't found it baby, that's for sure / You rip me up, you spread me all around / In the dust of the deed of time / And this is no case of lust you see / It's not a matter of you versus me / It's fine the way you want me on your own / But in the end it's always me alone / I'm losing my favourite game, / You're losing your mind again / I'm losing my baby, / Losing my favourite game / I only know what I've been working for / Another you so I could love you more / I really thought that I could take you there / But my experiment is not getting us anywhere / I had a vision I could turn you right / A stupid mission in a lethal fight / I should have seen it when my hope was new / My heart is black and my body is blue / And I'm losing my favourite game, / You're losing your mind again / I'm losing my favourite game, / You're losing your mind again / I'm losing my baby, / Losing my favourite game / I'm losing my favourite game (losing my favourite) / You're losing your mind again (I try) / I try but you're still the same (I try) / I'm losing my baby, you're losing a saviour and a saint / ______________________ / Name My Favorite Game / Artist The Cardigans / Album Gran Turismo / Original text by Nina Persson, Peter Anders Svensson / Copyright Universal Music Publishing Group"/>
