It feels like I only go backwards, baby
Every part of me says, "Go ahead"
I got my hopes up again, oh no, not again
Feels like we only go backwards, darling

I know that you think you sound silly when you call my name
But I hear it inside my head all day
Then I realize I'm just holding on to the hope that maybe your feelings don't show

It feels like I only go backwards baby
Every part of me says, "Go ahead"
Then I got my hopes up again, oh no, not again
Feels like we only go backwards, darling

Seed of all this indecision isn't me, oh no
'Cause I decided long ago if that's the way it seems to go
We draw us apart to get to something real, it feels

It feels like I only go backwards darling
Every part of me says, "Go ahead"
I got my hopes up again, oh no, not again
Feels like we only go backwards, darling
It feels like I only go backwards baby
Every part of me says, "Go ahead"
I got my hopes up again, oh no, not again
Feels like we only go backwards, darling
It feels like I only go backwards baby
Every part of me says, "Go ahead"
I got my hopes up again, oh no, not again
Feels like we only go backwards, darling
