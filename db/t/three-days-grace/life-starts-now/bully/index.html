He wakes up haunted with voices in his head
Nobody knows it but today he won't go unnoticed
He can't forget, can't forgive for what they said
He's never been so hurt but today the screaming is over

Blame the family, blame the bully, blame it on me
Maybe he needed to be wanted
Blame the family, blame the bully
Maybe he needed to be wanted

She takes the long way home, fighting her emotions
She's a loner but tonight she won't go unnoticed
If she can't remember when she loses her temper
Nobody knows her but tonight the silence is over

Blame the family, blame the bully, blame it on me
Maybe she needed to be wanted
Blame the family, blame the bully, blame it on me
Maybe she needed to be wanted

Blame the family, blame the bully, blame it on me
Maybe they needed

Blame the family, blame the bully, blame it on me
Maybe they needed to be wanted
Blame the family, blame the bully, blame it on me
Maybe they needed to be wanted

Wanted</div></div>
