    <div class="view"><pre>Every street in this city is the same to me
Everyone's got a place to be but there's no room for me
Am I to blame when the guilt and the shame hang over me?
Like a dark cloud that chases you down in the pouring rain

It's so hard to find someone
Who cares about you
But it's easy enough to find someone
Who looks down on you

Why is it so hard to find someone
Who cares about you
When it's easy enough to find someone
Who looks down on you?

It's not what it seems when you're not on the scene
There's a chill in the air
But there's people like me that nobody sees
So nobody cares

Why is it so hard to find someone
Who cares about you
When it's easy enough to find someone
Who looks down on you?

Why is it so hard to find someone
Who can keep it together when you've come undone?
Why is it so hard to find someone
Who cares about you?

I swear this time it won't turn out the same
'Cause now I've got myself to blame
And you'll know when we end up on the streets
That it's easy enough to find someone
Who looks down on you

Why is it so hard to find someone
Who cares about you
When it's easy enough to find someone
Who looks down on you?

Why is it so hard to find someone
Who can keep it together when you've come undone?
Why is it so hard to find someone
Who cares about you?</pre></div>
