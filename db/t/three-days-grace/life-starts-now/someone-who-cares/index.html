<title>Three Days Grace â€“ Someone Who Cares | Lyrics</title>
<meta name="description" content="Every street in this city is the same to me / Everyone's got a place to be but there's no room for me / Am I to blame when the guilt and the shame hang over me? / Like a dark cloud that chases you down in the pouring rain / It's so hard to find someone / Who cares about you / But it's easy enough to find someone / Who looks down on you / Why is it so hard to find someone / Who cares about you / When it's easy enough to find someone / Who looks down on you? / It's not what it seems when you're not on the scene / There's a chill in the air / But there's people like me that nobody sees / So nobody cares / Why is it so hard to find someone / Who cares about you / When it's easy enough to find someone / Who looks down on you? / Why is it so hard to find someone / Who can keep it together when you've come undone? / Why is it so hard to find someone / Who cares about you? / I swear this time it won't turn out the same / 'Cause now I've got myself to blame / And you'll know when we end up on the streets / That it's easy enough to find someone / Who looks down on you / Why is it so hard to find someone / Who cares about you / When it's easy enough to find someone / Who looks down on you? / Why is it so hard to find someone / Who can keep it together when you've come undone? / Why is it so hard to find someone / Who cares about you? / _______________________ / Name Someone Who Cares / Artist Three Days Grace / Album Life Starts Now"/>
