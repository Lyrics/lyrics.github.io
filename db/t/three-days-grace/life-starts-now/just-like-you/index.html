<title>Three Days Grace â€“ Just Like You | Lyrics</title>
<meta name="description" content="I could be mean, I could be angry / You know I could be just like you / I could be fake, I could be stupid / You know I could be just like you / You thought you were standing beside me / You were only in my way / You're wrong if you think that I'll be / Just like you (Just like you) / You thought you were there to guide me / You were only in my way / You're wrong if you think that I'll be / Just like you (Just like you) / You thought you were there to guide me / You were only in my way / You're wrong if you think that I'll be / Just like you / I could be cold, I could be ruthless / You know I could be just like you / I could be weak, I could be senseless / You know I could be just like you / You thought you were standing beside me / You were only in my way / You're wrong if you think that I'll be / Just like you (Just like you) / You thought you were there to guide me / You were only in my way / You're wrong if you think that I'll be / Just like you (Just like you) / You thought you were there to guide me / You were only in my way / You're wrong if you think that I'll be / Just like you / On my own 'cause I can't take livin' with you / I'm alone so I won't turn out like you want me to / You thought you were standing beside me / You were only in my way / You're wrong if you think that I'll be / Just like you (Just like you) / You thought you were there to guide me / You were only in my way / You're wrong if you think that I'll be / Just like you (Just like you) / You thought you were there to guide me / You were only in my way / You're wrong if you think that I'll be / Just like you / I could be mean, I could be angry / You know I could be just like you / ___________________ / Name Just Like You / Artist Three Days Grace / Album Life Starts Now"/>
