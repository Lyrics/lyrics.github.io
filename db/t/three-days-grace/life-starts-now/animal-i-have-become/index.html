<title>Three Days Grace â€“ Animal I Have Become | Lyrics</title>
<meta name="description" content="I can't escape this hell / So many times I've tried / But I'm still caged inside / Somebody get me through this nightmare / I can't control myself / So what if you can see the darkest side of me? / No one will ever change this animal I have become / Help me believe it's not the real me / Somebody help me tame this animal / (This animal, this animal) / I can't escape myself (I can't escape myself) / So many times I've lied (So many times I've lied) / But there's still rage inside / Somebody get me through this nightmare / I can't control myself / So what if you can see the darkest side of me? / No one will ever change this animal I have become / Help me believe it's not the real me / Somebody help me tame this animal I have become / Help me believe it's not the real me / Somebody help me tame this animal / Somebody help me through this nightmare / I can't control myself / Somebody wake me from this nightmare / I can't escape this hell / (This animal, this animal, this animal) / (This animal, this animal, this animal, this animal) / So what if you can see the darkest side of me? / No one will ever change this animal I have become / Help me believe it's not the real me / Somebody help me tame this animal I have become / Help me believe it's not the real me / Somebody help me tame this animal / This animal I have become / __________________________ / Name Animal I Have Become / Artist Three Days Grace / Album Life Starts Now"/>
