Give me a reason to stay here
'Cause I don't wanna live in fear

I can't stop the rain
But I can stop the tears
Oh, I can fight the fire
But I can't fight the fear

No more, I just can't live here
No more, I can't take it, can't take it
No more, what do we stand for
When we all live in fear?

Give me a reason to believe
'Cause you don't wanna see me leave

I can't stop the rain
But I can stop the tears
Oh, I can fight the fire
But I can't fight the fear

No more, I just can't live here
No more, I can't take it, can't take it
No more, what do we stand for
When we all live in fear?

No more, I just can't live here
No more, I can't take it, can't take it
No more, what do we stand for
When we all live in fear?
