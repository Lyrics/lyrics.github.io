<div><pre>I always knew that you'd come back to get me
And you always knew that it wouldn't be easy
To go back to the start to see where it all began
Or end up at the bottom to watch how it all ends

You tried to lie and say I was everything
I remember when I said, "I'm nothing without you"
(I'm nothing without you)

Somehow I found a way to get lost in you
Let me inside, let me get close to you
Change your mind, I'll get lost if you want me to
Somehow I found a way to get lost in you

You always thought that I left myself open
But you didn't know I was already broken
I told myself that it wouldn't be so bad
But pulling away took everything I had

You tried to lie and say I was everything
I remember when I said, "I'm nothing without you"
(I'm nothing without you)

Somehow I found a way to get lost in you
Let me inside, let me get close to you
Change your mind, I'll get lost if you want me to
Somehow I found a way to get lost in you, in you

The pain of it all, the rise and the fall
I see it all in you
Now every day I find myself saying
"I want to get lost in you"

"I'm nothing without you"

Somehow I found a way to get lost in you
Let me inside, let me get close to you
Change your mind, I'll get lost if you want me to
Somehow I found (Somehow I found)
A way to get lost in you

A way to get lost (A way to get lost)
In you (In you)</pre></div>
