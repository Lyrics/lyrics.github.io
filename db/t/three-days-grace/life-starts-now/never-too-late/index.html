    <div class="view"><div id="lyrics">This world will never be what I expected
And if I don't belong, who would've guessed it?
I will not leave alone everything that I own
To make you feel like it's not too late, it's never too late

Even if I say it'll be alright
Still I hear you say you want to end your life
Now and again we try to just stay alive
Maybe we'll turn it all around 'cause it's
Not too late, it's never too late

No one will ever see this side reflected
And if there's something wrong, who would have guessed it?
And I have left alone everything that I own
To make you feel like it's not too late, it's never too late

Even if I say it'll be alright
Still I hear you say you want to end your life
Now and again we try to just stay alive
Maybe we'll turn it all around 'cause it's
Not too late, it's never too late

The world we knew won't come back
The time we've lost, can't get back
The life we had won't be ours again

This world will never be what I expected
And if I don't belong

Even if I say it'll be alright
Still I hear you say you want to end your life
Now and again we try to just stay alive
Maybe we'll turn it all around 'cause it's
Not too late, it's never too late

Maybe we'll turn it all around 'cause it's
Not too late, it's never too late
(It's never too late)
It's not too late, it's never too late</div></div>
