Took me down to the river so I could drown, drown, drown
Looking up through the water, I kept sinkin' down, down, down
I feel like I'm dyin', I got one foot in the ground
Never knew what love was until you came around

You're goin' down
You're goin' down, down
You walk all over me, you never thought I'd be
The one who's laughing now, now that you're goin' down

Take you down to the basement, you look around, 'round, 'round
We sit there in silence, I watch you go down, down, down
I feel like I'm flyin', I got my head in the clouds
Never thought I was crazy until you came around

You're goin' down
You're goin' down, down
You walk all over me, you never thought I'd be
The one who's laughing now, now that you're goin' down

You're goin down, down
You walk all over me, you never thought I'd be
The one who's laughing now, now that you're goin' down

Took me down to the river so I could drown, drown, drown

You're goin' down
You're goin' down, down
You walk all over me, you never thought I'd be
The one who's laughing now, now that you're goin' down

(Down, down, down)
You're goin' down, down (Down)
You walk all over me, you never thought I'd be (Thought I'd be)
The one who's laughing now, now that you're goin' down
