If you feel so empty, so used up, so let down
If you feel so angry, so ripped off, so stepped on
You're not the only one refusing to back down
You're not the only one, so get up

Let's start a riot, a riot
Let's start a riot
Let's start a riot, a riot
Let's start a riot

If you feel so filthy, so dirty, so fucked up
If you feel so walked on, so painful, so pissed off
You're not the only one refusing to go down
You're not the only one, so get up

Let's start a riot, a riot
Let's start a riot
Let's start a riot, a riot
Let's start a riot

If you feel so empty, so used up, so let down
If you feel so angry, just get up

Let's start a riot, a riot
Let's start a riot

Let's start a riot, a riot
Let's start a riot
Let's start a riot, a riot
Let's start a riot (A riot)

Let's start a riot, a riot
Let's start a riot
Let's start a riot, a riot
Let's start a riot
