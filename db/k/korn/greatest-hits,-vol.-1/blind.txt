Are you ready?

This place inside my mind
A place I'd like to hide
You don't know the chances
What if I should die?

A place inside my brain
Another kind of pain
You don't know the chances
I'm so blind
Blind
Blind

Another means I'll find
To escape the pain inside
You don't know the chances
What if I should die?

A place inside my brain
Another kind of pain
You don't know the chances
I'm so blind
Blind
Blind

Deeper and deeper and deeper as I dream to
Live a life that seems to be
A lost reality
That I can never find a way to reach
My inner self-esteem is low
How deep can I go
In the ground that I lay
If I don't find a way to
See through the gray that clouds my mind
This time I look to see what's between the lines

I can see, I can see I'm goin' blind
I can see, I can see I'm goin' blind
I can see, I can see I'm goin' blind
I can see, I can see I'm goin' blind

I can see, I can see I'm goin' blind
I can see, I can see I'm goin' blind
I can see, I can see I'm goin' blind
I can see, I can see I'm goin' blind

I can see, I can see I'm goin' blind
I can see, I can see I'm goin' blind
I can see, I can see I'm goin' blind
I can see, I can see I'm goin' blind

I'm blind
I'm blind
I'm blind
I'm blind
