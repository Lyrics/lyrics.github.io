Oh, yo, pretty ladies around the world, got a weird thing to show you
So tell all the boys and girls, tell your brother, your sister and your mama too
We're about to go down, and you'll know just what to do
Wave your hands in the air like you don't care
Glide by the people as they start to look and stare
Do your dance, do your dance, do your dance quick, mama
Come on, baby, tell me what's the word

Word up
(Up, up)
Everybody say, when you hear they call you, you've got to get it underway
Word up
(Up, up)
It's the code word
No matter where you say it, you'll know that you'll be heard

Now all you sucker D.J.'s who think you're fly
There's got to be a reason, and we know the reason why
You try to put on those Airs and act real cool
But you've got to realize that you're acting like fools
If there's music we can use it, be free to dance
We don't have the time for psychological romance
No romance, no romance, no romance for me, mama
Come on, baby, tell me what's the word

The word up
(Up, up)
Everybody say, when you hear they call you, you've got to get it underway
Word up
(Up, up)
It's the code word
No matter where you say it, you'll know that you'll be heard

(Oh, oh, oh)

Word up
(Up, up)
Everybody say, when you hear they call you, you've got to get it underway
Word up
(Up, up)
It's the code word
No matter where you say it, you'll know that you'll be heard
Word up
(Up, up)
Everybody say, when you hear they call you, you've got to get it underway
Word up
(Up, up)
It's the code word
(Yeah)
No matter where you say it, you'll know that you'll be heard

Oh</pre></div>
