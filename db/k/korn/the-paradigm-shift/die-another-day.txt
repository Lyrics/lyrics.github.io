The madness creeping up on me,
The pressure's building I foresee,
Alienation's lurking
Spawning lunacy.

Slowly escaping
This wreckage in making
So don't look back for me.

Sometimes we take it all.
Nothing stands in our way.
We have to fight and crawl
To die another day.

Die another day.
Die another day.

Misery often misleads.
It creates things we cannot see.
Excessive thoughts are bound
Distorting reality.

Slowly escaping
This carnage in making
So don't look back for me.

Sometimes we take it all.
Nothing stands in our way.
We have to fight and crawl
To die another day.

Die another day.
Die another day.

Hello, are you there?
How come won't you listen?
I really don't care.
I really don't care .

Slowly escaping
This wreckage in making
Nothing will be the same.
So don't look back for me .

Sometimes we take it all.
Nothing stands in our way.
We have to fight and crawl
To die another day.

Sometimes we take it all.
Nothing stands in our way.
We have to fight and crawl
To die another day.
