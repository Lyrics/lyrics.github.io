I'm walking on a razor blade
Careful not to cross the line
Every little step I take
It's punishment time
Now I'm getting to the end of the blade
Slipping to the other side
Every little step I take
It's punishment time

Fighting to survive
There's no tomorrow
Fighting to survive
There's no today
Fight or flight
I'm losing my mind
Heavy on the heart
There's no tomorrow
Heavy on the heart
There's no today
Fight or flight
I'm losing my mind

I'm hanging like a bat today
Crucified by design
Every little move I make
It's punishment time
Now I'm sleeping on a bed of nails
They're breaking through one at a time
Cause every little move I make
The punishment's mine

Fighting to survive
There's no tomorrow
Fighting to survive
There's no today
Fight or flight
I'm losing my mind
Heavy on the heart
There's no tomorrow
Heavy on the heart
There's no today
Fight or flight
I'm losing my mind

I give and don't get
I try to my death
For something inside me
That makes me forget

Fighting to survive
There's no tomorrow
Fighting to survive
There's no today
Fight or flight
I'm losing my mind
Heavy on the heart
There's no tomorrow
Heavy on the heart
There's no today
Fight or flight
I'm losing my mind

Losing my mind! (x6)
