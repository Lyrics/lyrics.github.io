What's it gonna be today?
Keep chipping at my soul, and why must it disobey?
The only thing I loathe

How many times a day must I die?
Nothing's gonna work today
I'm killing time, looking all around to find a way
It's all wrong, knowing that my demon won
I'm done

Have I been lead astray?
Blaming the righteous, what do you think they'd say?
Attacking the altar

How many times a day must I die?
Nothing's gonna work today
I'm killing time, looking all around to find a way
It's all wrong, knowing that my demon won
I'm done

I'm done

I'm done with faceless feelings
I'm done with anything
I'm done trying to support you and sacrificing everything

Everything, everything

How many times a day must I die?
Nothing's gonna work today
I'm killing time, looking all around to find a way
It's all wrong, knowing that my demon won
I'm done
