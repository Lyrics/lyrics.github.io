Hey you, hey you, devil's little sister
Listening to your twisted transistor
Hold it between your legs, turn it up, turn it up
The wind is coming through, can't get enough

A lonely life where no one understands you
But don't give up, because the music do

Music do, music do
Music do, music do
Music do, music do

Because the music do, and then it's reaching
Inside you, forever preaching
Fuck you too, your scream's a whisper
Hang on you twisted transistor

Hey you, hey you, finally you get it
The world ain't fair, eat you if you let it
And as your tears fall on your breast, your dress
Vibrations coming through, you're in a mess

A lonely life where no one understands you
But don't give up, because the music do

Music do, music do
Music do, music do
Music do, music do

Because the music do, and then it's reaching
Inside you, forever preaching
Fuck you too, your scream's a whisper
Hang on you twisted transistor

Music do, music do
Music do, music do
Music do, music do
Music do, music do

Hey you, hey you, this won't hurt a bit
This won't hurt a bit, this won't hurt
Says who, says who?  Anesthetize this bitch!
A-nes-the-tize this bitch, anesthetize!
Just let me be, between you and me, don't fit
Don't fit!

Music do, and then it's reaching
Inside you, forever preaching
Fuck you too, your scream's a whisper
Hang on you twisted transistor.
