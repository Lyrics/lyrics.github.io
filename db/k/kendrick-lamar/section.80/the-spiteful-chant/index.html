    <div class="view"><pre>I know a lot of people that smile in my face
But talk behind my back every time I'm gone
So when they call my number, I don't never pick up
I don't owe you shit, bitch, leave me alone

I'm going big, suck my dick
I'm going big, suck my dick
I'm going big, suck my dick
I'm going big, suck my dick

Too many niggas, not enough hoes
And some of you niggas, acting like hoes
Stay to myself like loners do
Get high by myself, I'm not in the mood
To politic or be fake with you
We apologize if you ever knew
Too many niggas, and not enough hoes
And most of you niggas, acting like hoes

Everything I do is to alumni
I'mma take my time, I'mma master it
You should be mindful of a mastermind
Put a landmine right where your momma live
Now blow up, blow up, hold up, I've seen your kind before
See me as a dollar sign till I resign or you report
That I done you wrong, and I mean to know, my homie never
Nigga right now, it's now or never, nigga right now, I'm high as ever but however

I know a lot of people that smile in my face
But talk behind my back every time I'm gone
So when they call my number, I don't never pick up
I don't owe you shit, bitch, leave me alone

I'm going big, suck my dick
I'm going big, suck my dick
I'm going big, suck my dick
I'm going big, suck my dick

Too many niggas, not enough hoes
And some of you niggas, acting like hoes
Stay to myself like loners do
Get high by myself, I'm not in the mood
To politic or be fake with you
We apologize if you ever knew
Too many niggas, and not enough hoes
And most of you niggas, acting like hoes

Everybody heard that I fuck with Dre and they wanna tell me, I made it
Nigga I ain't made shit, if he gave me a handout, I'mma take his wrist and break it
Nigga, I'm faded off of that Nuvo, chilling with two hoes in here
And they tie my laces, living the Matrix as them pills disappear
Me and my niggas just acting bad HiiiPower conglomerate
Living that life and counting this cash old friends I no longer have

I know a lot of people that smile in my face
But talk behind my back every time I'm gone
So when they call my number, I don't never pick up
I don't owe you shit, bitch, leave me alone

I'm going big, suck my dick
I'm going big, suck my dick
I'm going big, suck my dick
I'm going big, suck my dick

Too many niggas, not enough hoes
And some of you niggas, acting like hoes
Stay to myself like loners do
Get high by myself, I'm not in the mood
To politic or be fake with you
We apologize if you ever knew
Too many niggas, and not enough hoes
And most of you niggas, acting like hoes

Schoolboy Q and Kendrick Lamar:
I remember when I came out and shit
Man, it's been so long since they see my dick
Probably been five months since I seen my seed
Goddammit, K. Dot, when it come to this?
When I was sleeping on couches
Nigga couldn't get a car, just a Glock for my voucher
Nigga I was mothafuckin' out, yeah
With the flashing lights had me stuck like reindeer
When I should have been making bank, yeah
I was somewhere stuck where the flame is
Motherfucker, see how far that I came here
Went broke and I came up in the same year (Can I get a hell yeah?)
Drop my tear, hold my joy (Show my pride)
(Music saved my fucking life, I'm doing right and you left behind
Feel my pain, now I'm styling, Hermès shit, I spent a thousand
Different homes, different islands)
Dropped my mixtape and it sold like an album

Kendrick Lamar:
Reason why I'm be going big, bitch, suck my dick
Yeah, I'm going big, bitch, suck my dick
Tell 'em I'm going big, bitch, suck my dick
Yeah, I'm going big, bitch, suck my dick, yeah

Too many niggas, not enough hoes
And some of you niggas, acting like hoes
Stay to myself like loners do
Get high by myself, I'm not in the mood
To politic or be fake with you
We apologize if you ever knew
Too many niggas, and not enough hoes
And most of you niggas, acting like hoes

Alori Joh:
Like hoes, like hoes, like hoes, like hoes
Like hoes, nigga actin' a hoe
Like hoes, like hoes, like hoes
You acting like a hoe, you acting like a hoe
You acting like a hoe, you acting like a hoe
Niggas actin like hoes, like hoes, like hoes, like hoes</pre></div>
