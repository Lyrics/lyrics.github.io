<title>KMFDM â€“ Today | Lyrics</title>
<meta name="description" content="Isolation / When you leave it's like I disappear / Desolation / Every time you go it feels like / Seconds slowly turn to minutes / A month of Sundays coming up / Time again it pulls me under / Wonder if I'll ever rise above / It's too much but not enough / Misery loves company / For a little bit of sympathy / It's here today but it's gone tomorrow / It's here today and today will never come again / It's here today / Desperation / Sinking into somewhere dark and cold / Deviation / A place I knew I didn't wanna go / To forget is all I know / Misery loves company / For a little bit of sympathy / It's here today but it's gone tomorrow / It's here today and today will never come again / It's here today but it's gone tomorrow / It's here today and today will never come again / It's here today / Minutes slowly turn to hours / Another moment passes by / Seconds of eternity / I wonder if it's time to say goodbye / It's here today but it's gone tomorrow / It's here today and today will never come again / It's here today but it's gone tomorrow / It's here today and today will never come again / It's here today / ___________ / Name Today / Artist KMFDM / Album Adios / Original text by Sascha Konietzko, Tim Skold"/>
