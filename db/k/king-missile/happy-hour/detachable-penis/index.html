<title>King Missile â€“ Detachable Penis | Lyrics</title>
<meta name="description" content="I woke up this morning / With a bad hangover / And my penis was missing again / This happens all the time, it's detachable / (Detachable penis) / This comes in handy a lot of the time / I can leave it home / get me in trouble / Or I can rent it out when I don't need it / But now and then I go to a party, / Get drunk, and the next morning / I can't, for the life of me, / Remember what I did with it / First I looked around my apartment / And I couldn't find it / So I called up where the party was / They hadn't seen it either / I asked them to check the medicine cabinet / 'Cause, for some reason I leave it there sometimes / But, not this time / So I told them if it pops up to let me know / I called a few people who were at the party / But they were of no help either / I was starting to get desperate / I really don't like being without my penis for too long / Make me feel like less of a man / And, I really hate having to sit down every time I take a leak / After a few hours searching the house, / Calling everyone I could think of, / I was starting to get very depressed, so / I went to the kia and ate breakfast / Then as I walked down the 2nd Avenue / Towards St. Marks place / Where all those people sell XXX / And other junk on the street / I saw my penis lying on a blanket / Next to a broken toaster oven / Some guy was selling it / I had to buy it off him / He wanted 22 bucks / But I talked him down to 17 / I took it home, washed it off / And put it back on / I was happy again, complete / People sometimes tell me / I should get it permanently attached, / But, I dunno... / Even if sometimes it's a pain in the ass / I like having a detachable penis / (Detachable penis) / (Detachable penis) / (Detachable penis) / (Detachable penis) / (Detachable penis) / (Detachable penis) / ______________________ / Name Detachable Penis / Artist King Missile / Album Happy Hour"/>
