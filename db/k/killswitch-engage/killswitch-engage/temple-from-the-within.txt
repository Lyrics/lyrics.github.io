Make me feel serenity
When all is revealed
So easy to look back in life

And question but I must
Seek the strength to push
Forward...;forward...;forward

I want to see a world so
Beautiful inside
As we drink of life
Absolve me through your suffering

Make me feel serenity
When all is revealed
So easy to look back in life

And question but I must
Seek the strength to push
Forward...;forward...;forward

Teach me to inscribe these words
Upon my heart
Cover me with the shadow
Of your hand

Suffer tears me down

I will not lose myself
In everything that tears me down
Because you stand by me
There's no one to blame
No one to blame for my transgressions

Teach me to inscribe these words
Upon my heart
Cover me with the shadow
Of your hand

I will not lose myself (in everything)
That tears me down (because you stand)
Stand by me

I want to see a world so
Beautiful inside
As we drink of life
Absolve me through your suffering

I will not lose myself
In everything that tears me down
Because you stand by me
There's no one to blame
No one to blame
