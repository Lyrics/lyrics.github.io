Gazing at the horizon
Lost in the cryptic majesty
Gazing at the horizon

So lost, what have we done
A slowly dying Earth
A suffocated wasteland
For convenience and so called, progression

Visions of prophecy
Faces pushed in the earth
Visions of prophecy

So lost, what have we done
A slowly dying Earth
A suffocated wasteland
For convenience and so called, progression

Nothing will change
Unless we inflict transition

Praying on bended knees (empty)
Closed eyes will not see (empty)
Praying on bended knees (empty)
Is there still time...

The sands of time
Slipping through our (our) fingers
(Is there still time)
Sand of time (Is there still time)

Gazing at the horizon
Lost in the cryptic majesty
Gazing at the horizon

So lost, what have we done
A slowly dying Earth
A suffocated wasteland
For convenience and so called, progression

Nothing will change
Unless we inflict transition

Praying on bended knees (empty)
Closed eyes will not see (empty)
Praying on bended knees (empty)
Is there still time...

The sands of time
Slipping through our (our) fingers
Is there still time
Is there still time

(Is there still time)
(Is there still time)
(Is there still time)
Is there...;still time

Burned and raped in name of humanity
I pray for death for your release
