    <div class="view"><div id="lyrics">There are two types of men on our Mother Earth
Some have all the luck, some just live in dirt
Here are several types of the color of the skin
But what's crucial is to lose or win

You feel so alive where the eagles cry
And you feel so strong on a mountain high
But in fact you are at his bottom just
His unattainable top seems to be a must

We will stay down,
We will stay down,
We will stay down,
Down where we belong

We will stay down,
We will stay down,
We will stay down,
Down where we belong

And the rain keeps knocking on our Mother Earth
And the snow keeps falling, is it really worth
To live through this ache and to die at last
When you're predestined and the die is cast?

Our thoughts are fading in a time that melts
Our flesh is fading as we've always felt
But we kid ourselves to meet heaven's feast
To rise up to God and to be released

We will stay down,
We will stay down,
We will stay down,
Down where we belong

We will stay down,
We will stay down,
We will stay down,
Down where we belong

You belong to us, to the human crap
Which will never win and succumbs in traps
That are set by others with deceitfulness
And you stumble into them with thankfulness

No one knows if we are to survive the storm
But I tell you man you are just a worm
Just a little error on a hopeless crust
You're sleazy man and your limbs will rust

We will stay down,
We will stay down,
We will stay down,
Down where we belong

We will stay down,
We will stay down,
We will stay down,
Down where we belong</div></div>
