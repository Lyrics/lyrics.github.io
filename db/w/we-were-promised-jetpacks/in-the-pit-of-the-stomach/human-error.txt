If I was a writer, I'd write my opinions
And save them for later
Just to see how wrong I could be

If I was a painter, I'd paint all my rainbows
in different colors, or probably just black and grey

If I was a writer, I'd write my opinions
And send them a letter
Just to see they listen to me and I say

Trial and error, I'm not sure I've been here before
I'm drowning in humans, I'm not sure I've been here before

If I was a writer, I'd write my opinions
And save them for later

Just to see how wrong I could be

If I was a painter, I'd paint all my pictures
in different colors, or probably just black and grey

If I was a writer, I'd write my opinions
And send them a letter
Just to see they listen to me and I say

Trial and error, I'm not sure I've been here before
I'm drowning in humans, I'm not sure I've been here before
I'm drowning in humans, And I'm sure I've been here before

So why'd you stand there laughing?
Holding your tongue like it was your sword.
So why'd you stand there laughing?
