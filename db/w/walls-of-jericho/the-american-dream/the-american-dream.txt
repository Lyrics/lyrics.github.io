Fuck the American Dream
I know it all too well, I've watched my whole life
I've felt those calloused hands and looked into those broken eyes
One more bleeding heart that will never see its time
You suffer to survive, it will bury you alive

Fuck this place, burn it down. Everything I've loved is gone
This is not my home, I've played my final song
Tear us down, free us all

Sell your soul for something meaningless
A slow death for the corporate mess, and we call this happiness
What are we left with in the end? Defeat
A lifetime of obedience kicking in your teeth

Fuck this place, burn it down. Everything I've loved is gone
This is not my home, I've played my final song
Tear us down, free us all

We were sold a promise of a better tomorrow
Fuck the American Dream
We were told that our choices were our own
Fuck the American Dream
Promised the opportunity of a lifetime
Fuck the American Dream
Deceived we could be all we can be
Fuck the American Dream
