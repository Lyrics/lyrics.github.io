This army of inspiration we came for our revenge
We'll raise the flag of discontent,
We know who we are and where we stand,
I know words can't change the world
But they can have an impact on life
Through some words that someone else wrote
I found hope, and hope is all we have.
Why sing another empty anthem?
When you know this world needs direction.

Hope is all we have. the hollow words you say
We both know they mean nothing
We know that your heart is hollow
We know that your words are shallow
But those words are all we have.
