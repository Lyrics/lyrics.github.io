<div><pre>Brother I am begging you
Please don't let this life destroy you
You spend so much time hiding inside
Cutting out the hurt with a knife

I can only watch you fall
Throw my heart against your walls
Why do you enjoy your pain?
Sister we are one and the same

Don't give up, just hold on
Give it time, it won't be long
I'm here to open up your eyes
Don't leave this part of us behind
Don't give up just hold on

I see the hard times on your face
If you'd hear my cries you'd change your ways

But it's like a trip through the past
I know you're on your own and fading fast
I'm with you

Don't give up, just hold on
Give it time, it won't be long
I'm here to open up your eyes
Don't leave this part of us behind
Don't give up just hold on

It kills me that I couldn't see
That someone I loved needed me
You are a part of who I am
I will fight this fight with you till the end

Don't give up, just hold on
Give it time, it won't be long
I'm here to open up your eyes
Don't leave this part of us behind
Don't give up, just hold on

Don't give up just hold on
Give it time, it won't be long
I'm here to open up your eyes
Don't leave this part of us behind
Don't give up, just hold on

Don't give up, just hold on
Don't give up, just hold on</pre></div>
