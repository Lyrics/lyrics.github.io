<title>Walls of Jericho â€“ Addicted | Lyrics</title>
<meta name="description" content="Brother I am begging you / Please don't let this life destroy you / You spend so much time hiding inside / Cutting out the hurt with a knife / I can only watch you fall / Throw my heart against your walls / Why do you enjoy your pain? / Sister we are one and the same / Don't give up, just hold on / Give it time, it won't be long / I'm here to open up your eyes / Don't leave this part of us behind / Don't give up just hold on / I see the hard times on your face / If you'd hear my cries you'd change your ways / But it's like a trip through the past / I know you're on your own and fading fast / I'm with you / Don't give up, just hold on / Give it time, it won't be long / I'm here to open up your eyes / Don't leave this part of us behind / Don't give up just hold on / It kills me that I couldn't see / That someone I loved needed me / You are a part of who I am / I will fight this fight with you till the end / Don't give up, just hold on / Give it time, it won't be long / I'm here to open up your eyes / Don't leave this part of us behind / Don't give up, just hold on / Don't give up just hold on / Give it time, it won't be long / I'm here to open up your eyes / Don't leave this part of us behind / Don't give up, just hold on / Don't give up, just hold on / Don't give up, just hold on / ______________ / Name Addicted / Artist Walls of Jericho / Album Redemption"/>
