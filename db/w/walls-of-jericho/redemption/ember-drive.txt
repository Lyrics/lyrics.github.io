The tears come strong again.
I wasn't ready for your time to end.
I swear i'd tear this world apart to save you.
I think about that day.
I'd do anything to forget the pain.
but the skies burned and the flowers died,
the flowers died in May.

(chorus)
I can't do this without you.
if I could hold you one more time I'd never let you go.
I can't do this without you.
if I could tell you one more time, that I love you.
(chorus)

I close my eyes.
I see your face.

I hold you in my heart.
angel, your my guardian.
I sing this song so you'll live on forever.
like a storm that rages on a
woman that would not back down.
the day you left will always burn, burn inside my soul.

(chorus)
I can't do this without you.
if I could hold you one more time I'd never let you go.
I can't do this without you.
if I could tell you one more time, that I love you.
(chorus)

I close my eyes.
I see your face.

(chorus)
I can't do this without you.
if I could hold you one more time I'd never let you go.
I can't do this without you.
if I could tell you one more time, that I love you.
(chorus)

I close my eyes.
I see your face.

I close my eyes.
I see your face
