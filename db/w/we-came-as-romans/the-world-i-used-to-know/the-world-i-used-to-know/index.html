    <div class="view"><pre>We've been living in the shadows everyday
Are we every gonna learn from our mistakes?
Our innocence, our ignorance were lost but they'll be found
The innocence of years we spent

I remember the day, between the past and the pain
We were never afraid of places unknown
There was nothing to fear, there was faith in the air
We will never be scared of letting go
What happened to the world I used to know?
What happened to the world I used to know?
What happened to the world I used to know?

We've been given all these chances everyday
Another step to take in this could change
Our innocence, our ignorance were lost but they'll be found
The innocence of years we spent

I remember the day, between the past and the pain
We were never afraid of places unknown
There was nothing to fear, there was faith in the air
We will never be scared of letting go
What happened to the world I used to know?
What happened to the world I used to know?

Even though it's not the same
Remember when we made our first steps
It's always just a thought away
Holding on to never forget
I still feel it now

I remember the days, between the past and the pain
We were never afraid of places unknown
There was nothing to fear, there was faith in the air
We will never be scared of letting go
What happened to the world I used to know?
What happened to the world I used to know?

We were living in the shadows everyday
Are we ever gonna learn from our mistakes?
What happened to the world I used to know?</pre></div>
