What's the addiction here? Your taste for the insincere
Disposable heart and you keep wanting more
The world at your fingertips but you can't get enough of it
Disposable heart that you just can't ignore

And I'm thinking that you're always gonna chase
And that you're never gonna change
And it leaves me wandering

Who's gonna be the one, one
Breath the air in your lungs, lungs?
Who's gonna be the savior of the week?
Looks like you fell in love, love
Till the next one shows up, up
You're gonna be the easiest to please
Who's gonna be the savior of the week?
Who's gonna be the savior of the week?

They're all replaceable, in your head you chase the whole
Illusion that they give you all that you need
But you're never satisfied, empty and lost inside
You'll come to find that it's all temporary

And I'm thinking that you're always gonna chase
And that you're never gonna change
And it leaves me wondering

Who's gonna be the one, one
Breath the air in your lungs, lungs?
Who's gonna be the savior of the week?
Looks like you fell in love, love
Till the next one shows up, up
You're gonna be the easiest to please
Who's gonna be the savior of the week?
Who's gonna be the savior of the week?

Savior
Savior
Savior

Who's gonna be the one, one
Breath the air in your lungs, lungs?
Who's gonna be the savior of the week?
Looks like you fell in love, love
Till the next one shows up, up
You're gonna be the easiest to please
Who's gonna be the savior of the week?
Who's gonna be the savior of the week?

Who's gonna be, who's gonna be
Who's gonna be the savior of the week?
Savior of the week
Who's gonna be, who's gonna be
Who's gonna be the savior of the week?
Savior of the week
Who's gonna be the one, one
Breath the air in your lungs?
