Regenerate, regenerate this life
Regenerate, regenerate, we've returned to reclaim

I miss the stable ground
We're waiting faces down
In a world that's sinking
I think this world and the stars
Aren't in each other's arms
In this world that's sinking

Stop living for yourself
You're just living in your own hell

To bring this back to a proper course
We will band together, stand together
To bring this back to a place I know
We will band together, we will regroup

Hear the voice inside you
Use the truth to guide you, now
This is our time to restore the faith
Regenerate, we will be the change

We're searching for a cure
'Cause our world is drowning
We're quick to guard our hearts
Forget we share our scars
In this world that's drowning

Stop living for yourself
You're just living in your own hell

To bring this back to a proper course
We will band together, stand together
To bring this back to a place I know
We will band together, we will regroup

Hear the voice inside you
Use the truth to guide you, now
This is our time to restore the faith
Regenerate, we will be the change

Why condemn when you can confide?
Why condemn when you can confide?
You're all just too busy picking a side

Why condemn when you can confide?
Regenerate, we will change this life
Why condemn when you can confide?
Regenerate, regenerate this life

To bring this back to a proper course
We will band together, stand together
To bring this back to a place I know
We will band together, we will regroup

Hear the voice inside you
Use the truth to guide you, now
This is our time to restore the faith
Regenerate, we will be the change

Regenerate, regenerate this life
Regenerate, regenerate, we've returned to reclaim
