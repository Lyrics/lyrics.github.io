<title>We Came As Romans â€“ Memories | Lyrics</title>
<meta name="description" content="So this is where it ends, the road we took together / Turn another page, however and forever / We only got one chance, the seconds are fading / Under the moonlight, we're wishing the same thing / I wanna remember, remember this moment / Remember this moment, remember this moment / Tonight, I'm thinking it's time / To burn it all down before the rest of our lives / And it can't last, so never look back / Give me your heart and I will give you my hand / 'Cause nothing's stopping you and me / From making all these memories / 'Cause nothing's stopping you and me / From making all these memories / Another line begins, I wonder what comes after / Knew we'd be the same, or be in different chapters / We only got one chance before it's all over / Under the moonlight I want you to hold on / We're gonna remember, remember this moment / Remember this moment, remember this moment / Tonight, I'm thinking it's time / To burn it all down before the rest of our lives / And it can't last, so never look back / Give me your heart and I will give you my hand / 'Cause nothing's stopping you and me / From making all these memories / 'Cause nothing's stopping you and me / From making all these memories / This is it, we're never getting that back / I'll admit I'll always become partly hers / (One last night to remember) / This is it, we're never getting that back / I'll admit I'll always become partly hers / (Let's take this world together, now) / Tonight, I'm thinking it's time / To burn it all down before the rest of our lives / And it can't last, so never look back / Give me your heart and I will give you my hand / 'Cause nothing's stopping you and me / From making all these memories / 'Cause nothing's stopping you and me / From making all these memories / 'Cause nothing's stopping you and me / (One last night to remember) / 'Cause nothing's stopping you and me / (Let's take this world together) / ______________ / Name Memories / Artist We Came As Romans / Album We Came As Romans"/>
