    <div class="view"><div id="lyrics">All the lights,
Were too bright to see the spark that I've been missing for too long.
Something I've been missing for too long.

My empty cup, could never fill another.
I have spilled all I've had to make things better.
But the love of all others, has made me new.

My empty cup,
Could never because of you fill another.
I am made new, I have spilled all I've had,
Because of you to make things better. I am made new.

We've all been broken
So let us make each other new.
So let us make each other new.

I've died inside every time I tried
to lie to myself about feeling alive, alive.
to lie to myself about feeling alive, alive.
I've died.

All the lights,
Were too bright to see the spark that I've been missing for too long.
Something I've been missing for too long.

All these distractions, kept me from seeing what I needed all along, an understanding.

I am speechless tonight
As I stare into the sky.
I feel endless compassion, forgiveness, and love,
I feel everyone who is looking up sharing this,
I feel unexplainably alive.

I need to understand what we've grown to be.

Tonight, when I look into the sky
I know this is why I am alive.
Tonight, when I look into the sky
I know this is why I am alive.
So sing with me if you feel this feeling.
So sing with me if you feel this feeling.
I'm alive.</div></div>
