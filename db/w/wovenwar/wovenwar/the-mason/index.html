<title>Wovenwar â€“ The Mason | Lyrics</title>
<meta name="description" content="No thought is given to the consequence, / Just a need to see what might become, / It's like we need to sabotage all of the love in our lives to prove control is so far from undone. / And I, / I have caved in again but I, / I'm building from the wreckage. / We bend, we break, we're forced to heal, / The toll it takes in time revealed. / I choose the shot to usher in deliverance, / Flood away the past I can't tow, / But like the river weathers stone it shapes and withers my home, / To a place I barely know. / We bend, we break, we're forced to heal, / The toll it takes in time revealed, / The trial in wake of it creates or tears us down, / We bend, we break, we learn to heal. / Failings are clay for mason hands to shape, / So strike away the grip of past mistakes. / And I, / I have caved in again but I, / I, / I have caved in again but. / We bend, we break, we're forced to heal, / The toll it takes in time revealed, / The trial in wake of it creates or tears us down, / We bend, we break, we learn to heal. / Failings are clay for mason hands to shape, / So strike away the grip of past mistakes. / _______________ / Name The Mason / Artist Wovenwar / Album Wovenwar"/>
