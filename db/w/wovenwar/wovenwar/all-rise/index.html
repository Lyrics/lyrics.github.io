    <div class="view"><div id="lyrics">Ooh, you feel the hunter's gaze
A shadow even in the dark of night
Scheming your early grave

He's going to leave you dead or dying
Draining all the blood he craves
You never thought you'd be meat for the market
What'd you expect when you sold your name

You have the chance to rise again
To cast the light that hides within
You have the chance to be a man
To rise again
To rise again
You have the chance to be a man
So cast the light that hides within

Ooh, when courage takes it's hold
You face down all the would-be masters
And break the ties that bind your goals

This is gonna be the moment
Your blood wakes and fills your veins
Stand tall with your strength, defy them
Become your own fate

You have the chance to rise again
To cast the light that hides within
You have the chance to be a man
To rise again
To rise again
You have the chance to be a man
So cast the light that hides within

Who stands the storm and faces
The horrors that darkness breeds?
Who will take the life they're given
And cast light for all to see?

Who stands the storm if not the brave?
Whats built from cowards that we praise?
Who stands the storm if not the brave?
Who stands the storm if not the brave?

You have the chance to rise again
To cast the light that hides

You have the chance to rise again
To cast the light that hides within
You have the chance to be a man
To rise again
To rise again
You have the chance to be a man
So cast the light that hides within
So cast the light that hides within</div></div>
