No thought is given to the consequence,
Just a need to see what might become,
It's like we need to sabotage all of the love in our lives to prove control is so far from undone.

And I,
I have caved in again but I,
I'm building from the wreckage.

We bend, we break, we're forced to heal,
The toll it takes in time revealed.

I choose the shot to usher in deliverance,
Flood away the past I can't tow,
But like the river weathers stone it shapes and withers my home,
To a place I barely know.

We bend, we break, we're forced to heal,
The toll it takes in time revealed,
The trial in wake of it creates or tears us down,
We bend, we break, we learn to heal.

Failings are clay for mason hands to shape,
So strike away the grip of past mistakes.

And I,
I have caved in again but I,
I,
I have caved in again but.

We bend, we break, we're forced to heal,
The toll it takes in time revealed,
The trial in wake of it creates or tears us down,
We bend, we break, we learn to heal.

Failings are clay for mason hands to shape,
So strike away the grip of past mistakes.
