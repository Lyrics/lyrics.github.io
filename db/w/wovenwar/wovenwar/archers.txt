We spent a decade building
A band of brothers to the bone
And it showed

From the reef's kiss calling
To the resistance rise we rose
We walked through fire blind
The march echoes for all time

But now the seasons changing
The turning tide
I've raised my sail to coming
Storm or calm alike

We are the humble phalanx
To raise the arrogance in foes
And it showed

We found a fraud in a bishop
And built a nation of flawed sons
We walked through fire blind
The march echoes for all time

But now the seasons changing
The turning tide
I've raised my sail to coming
Storm or calm alike

And though my vessels lone-manned with brazen broken hull
The waves will never take an
Armored archer core
Armored archer core

A means to believe
A reverie I couldn't reach
Never made a difference to me

Go on, our brother
You've only just begun
Live long with honor
From our fire you are born

But now the seasons changing
The turning tide
I've raised my sail to coming
Storm or calm alike

And though my vessels lone-manned with brazen broken hull
The waves will never take an
Armored archer core

But now the seasons changing
The turning tide (The turning tide)
I've raised my sail to coming
Storm or calm alike (Storm or calm alike)
Storm or calm alike
