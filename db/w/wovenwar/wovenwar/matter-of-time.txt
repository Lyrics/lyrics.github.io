Pull back the curtain
The one behind it has a different face
The inner workings
The gears are turning at a different pace

Time will change us all

The more that you question
The more the answers aren't what you want to hear

We fight to conceal the truth, but it's all a matter of time
Of time
The years wasted, persuaded to smile when it feels so wrong inside
Inside

Honesty or deception?
You can only hide it for so long
But we choose to be silent
Stick to the story

We fight to conceal the truth, but it's all a matter of time
Of time
The years wasted, persuaded to smile when it feels so wrong inside
Inside

How can we let ourselves
Continue this routine
The artificial beat
Of a heart that's long since ceased

How can we let ourselves
Continue this routine
The artificial beat
Of a heart that's long since ceased

We fight to conceal the truth, but it's all a matter of time
Of time
The years wasted, persuaded to smile when it feels so wrong inside
Inside (Inside)

We fight to conceal the truth, but it's all a matter of time
