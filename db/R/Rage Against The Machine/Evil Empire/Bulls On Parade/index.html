    <div class="view"><pre>Come wit it now
Come wit it now

The microphone explodes, shattering the molds
Either drop the hits like De-La-O or get the fuck off the commode
With the sure shot, sure to make the bodies drop
Drop and don't copy, yo, don't call this a co-opt

Terror rains, drenchin', quenchin' the thirst of the power dons
That five-sided Fist-a-gon
The rotten sore on the face of Mother Earth gets bigger
The trigger's cold, empty ya purse

Rally 'round the family with a pocket full of shells
They rally 'round the family with a pocket full of shells
They rally 'round the family with a pocket full of shells
They rally 'round the family with a pocket full of shells

Weapons, not food, not clothes, not shoes, not need
Just feed the war, cannibal animal
I walk the corner to the rubble that used to be a library
Line up to the mind cemetery now

What we don't know keeps the contracts alive and movin'
They don't gotta burn the books, they just remove 'em
While arms warehouses fill as quick as the cells
Rally 'round the family, pockets full of shells

Rally 'round the family with a pocket full of shells
They rally 'round the family with a pocket full of shells
They rally 'round the family with a pocket full of shells
They rally 'round the family with a pocket full of shells

Bulls on parade
Uh

Come wit it now
Come wit it now
Bulls on parade

Bulls on parade
Bulls on parade
Bulls on parade
Bulls on parade</pre></div>
