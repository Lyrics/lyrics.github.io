    <div class="view"><pre>She got down on hands and knees
One ear against the ground
Holding her breath to hear something
But the dirt made not a sound, tonight

Echoes of songs still lurk on distant foreign shores
Where we danced just to please the gods that only ask for more
And so it goes

But still we give ourselves to this
We can't spend our lives waiting to live

On cold nights
In a prayer for dawn
The daylight
Isn't what she wants

The concrete
Calls my name again
I'm falling
Through the cracks I slip

The postcard says wish you were here
But I'd rather I was there
Holding on to the simple things before they disappear
That's what I meant

But that was then, and this is now
I'll make it up to you somehow

On cold nights
In a prayer for dawn
The daylight
Isn't what she wants

The concrete
Calls my name again
I'm falling
Through the cracks I slip

A destination, a fading smile
Another station, another mile
Another day gone, I swore that I will
Be there before dawn
So be there, I will...

She got down on hands and knees
One ear against the ground
Holding her breath to hear something
Anything at all

The dirt whispered, "Child, I'm coming home"

On cold nights
In a prayer for dawn
The daylight
Isn't what she wants

The concrete
Calls my name again
I'm falling
Through the cracks I slip, I slip...
Through the cracks I slip... (Through the cracks I slip...)
Through the cracks I slip...</pre></div>
