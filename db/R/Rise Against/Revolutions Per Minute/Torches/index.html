    <div class="view"><pre>On clearer days I can see the lights from my bedroom door
On windy nights I can smell the lake as it drifts to me from the shore
The traffic lights silently change a thousand times a day
But I'm still waiting
Yeah, I'm still waiting

And if my hand could block the sun
Would we ever wake up?
And if I turned back all these clocks
Would that be time enough?

I can't remember exactly when this longing began
But I know it wasn't before the day you touched my hand
Laugh and shout in blissful daze and numbers are exchanged
But, I'm still waiting
Yeah, I'm still waiting

And if my hands could block the sun
Would we ever wake up?
And if I turned back all these clocks
Would that be time enough?

So put your hands where I can see them
And shut your mouth
I know who you are
In a world void of feeling or heart
I know that we are the torches in the dark

Let's break this down
Let's make this count
Let's leave this one-horse town
No better time than now

Let's break this down
Let's make this count
Let's leave this one-horse town
No better time than now

The angels dance, like feathers float
They're here to see and to be seen
The clock strikes two, the music slows
And each one slowly dons their wings

Once outside they all pair off
And hand in hand they leave
But I'm still waiting
Yeah, I'm still waiting

And if my hands could block the sun
Would we ever wake up?
And if I turned back all these clocks
Would that be time enough?

Would we ever wake up?</pre></div>
