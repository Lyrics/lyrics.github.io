    <div class="view"><pre>Floating in the clouds, I'm giving up the fight
A voice is calling out, I'm walking into the light

We used to race a thousand miles a day so fast
Feet they barely even touched the ground
We used to fly to places out beyond our own little world
The fury and the sound

I saw it flicker like a television set
Bright flashes of a warning sign
Flipping channels in a world gone static
Eroding away line by fading line

Underwater for years we found
So much harder to swim than drown
The current takes us now we're walking into the light

Are you dying all your life?
(Walking into the light)
Broken, beat, and tired out
(Walking into the light)
You want to live but don't know how
(Walking into the light)
Diagnosis: Sudden life
(Walking into the light)
Can no one revive me now?
Feels like I'm walking into the light

Woke up floating on a wave of golden sound
Tunnel vision and a great beyond
Heart beating like a rhythm slowing
Down til it's gone an echo of a song

Flat line and a closing bell whisper a warm farewell
The flames are beckoning as we're walking into the light

Are you dying all your life?
(Walking into the light)
Broken, beat, and tired out
(Walking into the light)
You want to live but don't know how
Diagnosis: Sudden life
(Walking into the light)
Can no one revive me now?
Feels like I'm walking into the light

Don't suppose that you know the way?
Don't suppose that you care?

I see lights up ahead and
Hear choirs of angels ring in my ears
But you know that had you a choice
You would go back do it again
We all have unfinished business to tend

So no I won't go gentle into that good night
You can keep your candle
I'm walking away from the light
Yeah, I'm walking away from the light
I'm walking away from the light
I'm walking away from the light
Now I'm walking away from the light

Diagnosis: Sudden life
(Walking away from the light)
I woke up my heart racing
(Walking away from the light)
I'm at a loss explaining why
(Walking away from the light)
Are you dying all your life
(Walking away from the light)
Then put your darkest days behind
Let life flash right before your eyes
And for the very first time
It feels like I'm walking away from the light</pre></div>
