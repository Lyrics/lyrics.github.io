    <div class="view"><pre>A currency of heartache and sorrow
The air we breathe is stale with mold
To shadows we are slaves digging deeper everyday
But emptiness is growing so old

Headlamps light the tunnels we wander
They shimmer and they dance on the walls
We're lost inside these caves as the chances of escape
Grow slimmer 'til there's no chance at all

This ink it travels from the page
Up my hand into my veins
Choking on the stories I've told
If there are words here left to say
I just wanna let you know

I'm falling on my knees right now
I'm covered in the mess I made
These colors used to wash right out
But now they are a part of me
I've been searching for a remedy
When all along it's been in front of me
I need you here, I need you now
Right now

We traffic in the blackest of markets
Trade misery like diamonds and gold
The angst that we exchange for applause and petty praise
Is finally now taking its toll

But there's a world above the ground
A life that we can lead
We're washing off the dirt from our clothes
I don't wanna live without
No I just wanna let you know

I'm falling on my knees right now
I'm covered in the mess I made
These colors used to wash right out
But now they are a part of me
I've been searching for a remedy
When all along it's been in front of me
I need you here, I need you now
Right now
Right now

(Black stains)
They mark me like a letter
(Don't fade)
Cracking under the pressure
(Black stains)
Nothing stays gold

But there's a world above the ground
A life that we can lead
But we're lost deep down in these holes
And I have seen the way out
Now I just wanna let you know

I'm falling on my knees right now (black stains)
I'm covered in the mess I made (don't fade)
These colors used to wash right out (black stains)
But now they are a part of me
I've been searching for a remedy
When all along it's been in front of me
You're voice it washed the stains away

Woah oh ohh ohhh oh oh
(Washed the stains away)
Woah oh ohh ohhh oh oh</pre></div>
