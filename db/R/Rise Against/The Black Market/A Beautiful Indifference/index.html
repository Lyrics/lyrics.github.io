    <div class="view"><pre>There's a struggle coming, but to conquer, first they must divide
The machines keep humming night and day
How are we so unaware
Why are you not afraid?

Protests are drumming while you turn your nose and roll your eyes
Knee-jerk reactions so ingrained
Judging from an arm chair

Cause there is hate and there is love and there is loss
But there is light and there is dark, then there is us
And whether this world burns, is none of your concern
Caught up in a ticker-tape parade

I have learned to stand up and just to walk away
Sometimes the cold hearts aren't worth the love or the hate
Learn to let go, learn to walk away
Up from the shadows I'm seduced by the light of the flame
But this time I'm here to stay

Gunpowder residue, bright lights and turpentine
True colors shining through, as we are stripped of our exteriors

Now, cause there is hate and there is love and there is loss
But there is right and there is wrong, then there is us
We're falling until

We learn to stand up and just to walk away
Sometimes the cold hearts aren't worth the love or the hate
Learn to let go, learn to walk away
Up from the shadows I'm seduced by the light of the flame
But this time I'm here to stay

Feet first into the quicksand, every day we are surrendering
Never straying from the game plan
I keep hoping you will take my hand and stand up

The water's overflowing, the walls are breaking
But I know where I'm going, that we can make it
And there's a light still glowing and I will chase it
And I've been lost before and I have been led astray

But this time I'm here to stay</pre></div>
