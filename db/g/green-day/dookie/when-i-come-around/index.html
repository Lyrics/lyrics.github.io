<title>Green Day â€“ When I Come Around | Lyrics</title>
<meta name="description" content="Well, I heard you crying loud / All the way across town / 'Cause you've been searching for that someone and it's me out on the prowl / As you sit around feeling sorry for yourself / Well, don't get lonely now / And dry your whining eyes / I'm just roaming for the moment, sleazing my backyard, so don't get / So uptight you've been thinking about ditching me / No time to search the world around / 'Cause you know where I'll be found / When I come around / I heard it all before / So don't knock down my door / I'm a loser and a user, so I don't need no accuser / To try and slag me down because I know you're right / So go do what you like / Make sure you do it wise / You may find out that your self-doubt means nothing was ever there / You can't go forcing something if it's just not right / No time to search the world around / 'Cause you know where I'll be found / When I come around / Woo / No time to search the world around / 'Cause you know where I'll be found / When I come around / When I come around / When I come around / When I come around / ________________________ / Name When I Come Around / Artist Green Day / Album Dookie"/>
