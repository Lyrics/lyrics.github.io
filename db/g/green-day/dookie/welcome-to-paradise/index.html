<title>Green Day â€“ Welcome To Paradise | Lyrics</title>
<meta name="description" content="Dear mother, can you hear me whining? / It's been three whole weeks since I have left your home / This sudden fear has left me trembling / 'Cause now it seems that I am out here on my own and I'm feeling so alone / Pay attention to the cracked streets and the broken homes / Some call it slums, some call it nice / I want to take you through a wasteland I like to call my home / Welcome to paradise / A gunshot rings out at the station / Another urchin snaps and left dead on his own / It makes me wonder why I'm still here / For some strange reason, it's still now feeling like my home and I'm never gonna go / Pay attention to the cracked streets and the broken homes / Some call it slums, some call it nice / I want to take you through a wasteland I like to call my home / Welcome to paradise / Dear mother, can you hear me laughing? / It's been six whole months since I have left your home / It makes me wonder why I'm still here / For some strange reason, it's still now feeling like my home and I'm never gonna go / Pay attention to the cracked streets and the broken homes / Some call it slums, some call it nice / I want to take you through a wasteland I like to call my home / Welcome to paradise, whoa, paradise / _________________________ / Name Welcome To Paradise / Artist Green Day / Album Dookie"/>
