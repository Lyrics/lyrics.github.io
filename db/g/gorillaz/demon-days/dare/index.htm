It's Dare
It's Dare

You've got to press it on you
You just think it
That's what you do, baby
Hold it down there

Jump with them all and move it
Jump back and forth
And feel like you were there yourself
Work it out

Never did no harm
Never did no harm

It's Dare
It's coming up

You've got to press it on you

That's what you do, baby
Hold it down there

Jump with them all and move it
Jump back and forth
And feel like you were there yourself
Work it out

Never did no harm
