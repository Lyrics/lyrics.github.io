<title>Godhead â€“ Eleanor Rigby | Lyrics</title>
<meta name="description" content="Eleanor Rigby / Picks up the rice in the church where a wedding has been / Lives in a dream / Waits at the window / Wearing the face that she keeps in a jar by the door / Who is it for? / All the lonely people, / Where do they all come from? / All the lonely people, / Where do they all belong? / Father McKenzie / Writing the words of a sermon that no one will hear / No one comes near / Look at him working / Darning his socks in the night when there's nobody there / What does he care? / All the lonely people, / Where do they all come from? / All the lonely people, / Where do they all belong? / Ah, look at all / The lonely people / Ah, look at all / The lonely people / Eleanor Rigby / Died in the church and was buried along with her name / Nobody came / Father McKenzie / Wiping the dirt from his hands as he walks trom the grave / No one was saved / All the lonely people, / Where do they all come from? / All the lonely people, / Where do they all belong? / Ah, look at all / The lonely people / Ah, look at all / The lonely people / All the lonely people... / All the lonely people... / All the lonely people... / All The lonely people... / All The lonely people... / All The lonely people... / All The lonely people... / All The lonely people... / Ah, look at all / The lonely people / Ah, look at all / The lonely people / Eleanor Rigby / Died in the church and was buried along with her name / Ah, look at all / The lonely people / (aah) / All the lonely people, / Where do they all come from? / All the lonely people, / Where do they all belong? / Ah, look at all / The lonely people / Ah, look at all / The lonely people / Eleanor Rigby / Died in the church and was buried along with her name / ___________________ / Name Eleanor Rigby / Artist Godhead / Album 2000 Years of Human Error"/>
