<title>Godhead â€“ The Hate In Me | Lyrics</title>
<meta name="description" content="You've got to wake up / No time to make up / The life you wasted / And everything that broke apart / Don't disregard me / Or this emergency / You are the one / That has started this atrocity / I've got a feeling inside / That you've got something to hide / And that's what / I'm awaiting for / There's no apology / For your hypocrisy / I'm coming down on you / With all of my ferocity / I feel the hate in me awakening / (can't stop remembering) / I've hurt my face to stop my suffering / (can't stop remembering) / I feel the hatred / From every word you said / Consume me until I'm driven / To my death bed / Now you're inside of me / You'll never let me breath / I see the terror / Of all your inhumanity / I feel the hate in me awakening / (can't stop remembering) / I've hurt my face to stop my suffering / (can't stop remembering) / I can't believe the fear and doubt you bring / (can't stop remembering) / You made me what I am it's sickening / I feel the hate in me awakening / (can't stop remembering) / I've hurt my face to stop my suffering / (can't stop remembering) / I can't believe the fear and doubt you bring / (can't stop remembering) / You made me what I am it's sickening / ____________________ / Name The Hate In Me / Artist Godhead / Album Evolver"/>
