<title>Godhead â€“ Rotten | Lyrics</title>
<meta name="description" content="She cries herself to sleep / Feeling thing she's never known before / It tastes like rotten candy apples / It burns like all the lies she's never heard before / And all her dreams are shattered / On the floor again / And all her tries have failed / And lie among the dust / And all the time they spent apart / She hoped would make him see / That she was just the one for him / But he never looked inside himself / To find the empty heart of cold / That wraps around his soul of black / And buries him / In his grave of pain / And all her dreams are shattered / On the floor again / And all her tries have failed / And lie among the dust / He'll never understand / Why she cannot see the end / Of the world she made for them / And everything she grew to love / She'll never see inside / That he told her only lies / And convictions that he had / Just fell into an empty void / And all that really mattered / To make her whole again / Was broken outside / And never came in from the cold / ____________ / Name Rotten / Artist Godhead / Album Evolver"/>
