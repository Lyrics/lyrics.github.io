<title>Godhead â€“ Dream | Lyrics</title>
<meta name="description" content="If you'd listen / To what I have to say to you / You would never be the same again / You're like porcelain / Close your eyes / Feel inside / You wonder why I brought you here / If you'd open up just once to hear my words / I would say no more / I would say no more / And you'd feel the same / Dream like I do / Killing every part of you / Dream like I do / No matter what they think of you / All this time / You were surrounded by the ones who lie / Close to you / And they held you from their ugly truth / I'd do anything to reach inside you / Make you understand / That the answer to your question / Lies in front of you / Dream like I do / Killing every part of you / Dream like I do / No matter what they think of you / I would say no more / I would say no more / And you'd feel the same / Dream like I do / (See the way your heart is dying all around your world) / Killing every part of you / Dream like I do / (Feel the way your soul stops trying. You, the prisoner) / No matter what they think of you / Dream like I do / (See the way your heart is dying all around your world) / Killing every part of you / Dream like I do / (Feel the way your soul stops trying. You, the prisoner) / No matter what they think of you / ___________ / Name Dream / Artist Godhead / Album Evolver"/>
