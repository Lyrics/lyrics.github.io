Under here
There's no light
Take from me my sight
I don't need it anymore

You came here
With your fire
Burned out my desire
Took the whisper from the flame

I never wanted
I never knew
It was you

I stood there helpless
Far and away
Nothing left to say

And it feels the same that it did before
Only without you

And I cry the same that I did before
Only without you

I failed to see the light that was for me
I choked my resurrection
