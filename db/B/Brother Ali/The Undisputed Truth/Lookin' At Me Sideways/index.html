<br/><span></span>I play high stakes made crook in a crime wave
<br/><span></span>Must be something on my face
<br/><span></span>Yelling that they ought no tell em what they spellin on MySpace dot com
<br/><span></span>Bold type face rhetoric
<br/><span></span>You gon' clickety click and get your head split
<br/><span></span>What the hell you look like on a message board
<br/><span></span>Discussing whether or not the brother is hard core
<br/><span></span>I ain't got to prove to any of you
<br/><span></span>That anything I ever said was is the truth but I'm ready to do it
<br/><span></span>And do it leisurely, Ant give 10 beats a week
<br/><span></span>So fuck it I'll put the record how it needs to be
<br/><span></span>I understand I ain't perfect alright
<br/><span></span>I been a thugged out nerd all my life
<br/><span></span>Thank God I ain't got to serve dirt or snatch purses at night
<br/><span></span>I feed people with the verses I write
<br/><span></span>And I fill them with my personal strife
<br/><span></span>Had some of y'all concerned for my life
<br/><span></span>For what I've had the nerve to recite
<br/><span></span>I cut my grass grow, bring the serpants to light
<br/><span></span>Now baby you ain't never heard me I'm tight
<br/><span></span>And I'm surgical like, with this bitch Jake
<br/><span></span>You know that shit fuck around and get a closed casket and I'm old fashioned
<br/><span></span>Trying to figure out how we got from Whipper Whip to this silly bullshit
<br/><span></span>It's just so tragic
<br/><span></span>But it ain't impossible to solve
<br/><span></span>I ain't learned jack shit from Dorian at all
<br/><span></span>Let me hear you abusing the culture I adore
<br/><span></span>I'll come across the hall and get involved like this here<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>I'm just here to play my part, and inbetween scenes got to stay on guard
<br/><span></span>I ain't way out y'all, you just don't get me dog
<br/><span></span>You gon fuck around and miss me dog, it ain't my fault
<br/><span></span>And they love the way I talk
<br/><span></span>Eyes get real wide when I say my thoughts
<br/><span></span>I ain't way out y'all, you just don't get me dog
<br/><span></span>You gon fuck around and miss me dog, it ain't my fault<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>Tabernacle my hand, expand to the size of a big black granite statue
<br/><span></span>Divide it by the lightning speed that they can move
<br/><span></span>It ain't an autograph, do that math I'm a smack you
<br/><span></span>I like to pull up my pants and lean back too
<br/><span></span>Organic vegetables, mix em with fast food
<br/><span></span>I'm Howard Stern meets Howard Zinn
<br/><span></span>How could you not find a pal in him and get attracted too
<br/><span></span>I take it back for you when possible
<br/><span></span>If your hear this then I'm confiding in you
<br/><span></span>Pop call me, "Ali what's bothering you
<br/><span></span>Don't you want to tell your friends you and your father are cool"
<br/><span></span>"NO." You got more X's than the Honorable Elijah Muhammed do
<br/><span></span>But that ain't my problem with you
<br/><span></span>Truth is your just an impossible dude
<br/><span></span>You get hostile with fools when their honest with you
<br/><span></span>I could make me a snide little comment or two
<br/><span></span>But I don't see what that nonsense would prove
<br/><span></span>I don't give fake props to the dude or walk around in his shoes
<br/><span></span>I just do what the Qu'ran says to do and respect him
<br/><span></span>Now I ain't even here to get clandestine
<br/><span></span>But best believe I'm a get what's destined
<br/><span></span>Be it an Escalade or a fixed up F10
<br/><span></span>It's better than this bus, best friend believe that
<br/><span></span>I ain't got a free minute to lean back
<br/><span></span>Spiderman 2 coming out and Faheem need that
<br/><span></span>Plus I wanna teach him how to read on a Leap Pad
<br/><span></span>Shining bright, smiling like "look at me dad! "
<br/><span></span>That's the shit that I'm in to I defend to the death
<br/><span></span>That I'm every bit as gangster as them fools
<br/><span></span>If I wasn't G I wouldn't flow like this
<br/><span></span>If you were really a G you wouldn't know I exist, you bitch
<br/><span></span>(I don't understand what they're sayin'
<br/><span></span>But little did they know they could get a smack for that, man)
<br/><span></span>So I'd advise you to shut the fuck up
<br/><span></span>Silly muhfucka<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>I'm just here to play my part, and inbetween scenes got to stay on guard
<br/><span></span>I ain't way out y'all, you just don't get me dog
<br/><span></span>You gon fuck around and miss me dog, it ain't my fault
<br/><span></span>And they love the way I talk
<br/><span></span>Eyes get real wide when I say my thoughts
<br/><span></span>I ain't way out y'all, you just don't get me dog
<br/><span></span>You gon fuck around and miss me dog, it ain't my fault<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>I said clap your hand to the beat y'all
<br/><span></span>'Cause the beat make you clap your hands
<br/><span></span>I said clap your hand to the beat y'all
<br/><span></span>'Cause the beat make you clap your hands<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>I said clap your hand to the beat y'all
<br/><span></span>'Cause the beat make you clap your hands
<br/><span></span>I said clap your hand to the beat y'all
