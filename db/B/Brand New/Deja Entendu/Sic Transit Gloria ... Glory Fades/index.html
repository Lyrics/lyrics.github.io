<br/><span></span>Shake from head to toe while your left hand do the show me around
<br/><span></span>Quickens your heartbeat, beats me straight into the ground<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>You don't recover from a night like this
<br/><span></span>A victim still lying in bed, completely motionless
<br/><span></span>A hand moves in the dark to a zipper
<br/><span></span>Hear a boy bracing tight against sheets barely whisper
<br/><span></span>This is so messed up<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>Upon arrival, the guests had all stared
<br/><span></span>Dripping wet and clearly depressed, he'd headed straight for the stairs
<br/><span></span>No longer cool, but a boy in a stitch
<br/><span></span>Unprepared for a life full of lies and failing relationships<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>(Up the stairs)
<br/><span></span>He keeps his hands low, he doesn't wanna blow it
<br/><span></span>(The station where)
<br/><span></span>He's wet from head to toe, and his eyes give her the up and the down
<br/><span></span>(The act becomes)
<br/><span></span>His stomach turns and he thinks of throwing up
<br/><span></span>(The art of growing up)
<br/><span></span>But the body on the bed beckons forward and he starts growing up<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>The fever, the focus
<br/><span></span>The reasons that I had to believe you weren't too hard to sell
<br/><span></span>Die young and save yourself
<br/><span></span>The tickle, the taste of
<br/><span></span>It used to be the reason I breathed, but now it's choking me up
<br/><span></span>Die young and save yourself<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>She hits the lights, this doesn't seem quite fair
<br/><span></span>Despite everything he learned from his friends
<br/><span></span>He doesn't feel so prepared
<br/><span></span>She's breathing quiet and smooth, he's gasping for air<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>"This is the first and last time," he says
<br/><span></span>She fakes a smile and presses her hips into his
<br/><span></span>He keeps his hands pinned down at his sides
<br/><span></span>He's holding back from telling her exactly what it really feels...; like<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>He is the lamb, she is the slaughter
<br/><span></span>She's moving way too fast and all he wanted was to hold her
<br/><span></span>Nothing that he tells her's really having an effect
<br/><span></span>He whispers that he loves her but she's probably only looking for s...;<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>(Up the stairs)
<br/><span></span>So much more than he could ever give
<br/><span></span>(The station where)
<br/><span></span>A life free of lies and a meaningful relationship
<br/><span></span>(The act becomes)
<br/><span></span>He keeps his hands pinned down at his sides
<br/><span></span>(The art of growing up)
<br/><span></span>He waits for it to end and for the achin' in his guts to subside<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>The fever, the focus
<br/><span></span>The reasons that I had to believe you weren't too hard to sell
<br/><span></span>Die young and save yourself
<br/><span></span>The tickle, the taste of
<br/><span></span>It used to be the reason I breathed, but now it's choking me up
