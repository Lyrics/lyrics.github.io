<br/><span></span>Do you believe in anything?
<br/><span></span>Do you carry it around just to burn things down?<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>Meet me tonight on the turnpike, my darling
<br/><span></span>'Cause we believe in everything
<br/><span></span>If we sweat all these debts, then we're sure to drown
<br/><span></span>So we strap ourselves up to this engine now
<br/><span></span>With a god who we found laying under the back seat<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>What did you learn tonight?
<br/><span></span>You're shouting so loud, you barely enjoy this broken thing
<br/><span></span>You're a voice that never sings, is what I say
<br/><span></span>You were freezing over hell
<br/><span></span>You were bringing on the end, you do so well
<br/><span></span>You can only blame yourself, it's what I say<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>(Help)
<br/><span></span>All that you've got is to ignore the things, that I was sorry
<br/><span></span>And sweep me under the rug
<br/><span></span>While you're beating with a book everyone, the book tells you to love<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>There is an ember in the heart of the kiln
<br/><span></span>And it's burning hot with love
<br/><span></span>Burning out my sins until there's nothing but dust
<br/><span></span>Holding me with care into your cigarette
<br/><span></span>'Cause the god I believe in, he worked on a campaign trail<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>What did you learn tonight?
<br/><span></span>You're shouting so loud, you barely enjoy this broken thing
<br/><span></span>You're a voice that never sings, is what I say
<br/><span></span>You were freezing over hell
<br/><span></span>You were bringing on the end, you do so well
<br/><span></span>You can only blame yourself, it's what I say<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>Who do you carry the torch for, my young man?
<br/><span></span>Do you believe in anything?
<br/><span></span>Do you carry it around just to burn things to the ground?<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>What did you learn tonight?
<br/><span></span>You're shouting so loud, you barely enjoy this broken thing
<br/><span></span>You're a voice that never sings, is what I say
<br/><span></span>You were freezing over hell
<br/><span></span>You were bringing on the end, you do so well
<br/><span></span>You can only blame yourself, it's what I say<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>Feels like
<br/><span></span>(What did you learn tonight?)
<br/><span></span>We could escape the armor
<br/><span></span>(You're shouting so loud, you barely enjoy this broken thing)
<br/><span></span>I might throw it away
<br/><span></span>For fear of the silver sun
<br/><span></span>(You're a voice that never sings, is what I say)<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>If you try
<br/><span></span>(You were freezing over hell)
<br/><span></span>Running a maze of your lies
<br/><span></span>(You were bringing on the end, you do so well)
<br/><span></span>It's too hard to save
<br/><span></span>You've thrown out everyone
