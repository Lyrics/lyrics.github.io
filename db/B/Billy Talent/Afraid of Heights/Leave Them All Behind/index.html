<br/><span></span>It's easy to pretend until they turn their back on you.
<br/><span></span>And all the ones that bring you down, their colours weren't that true.
<br/><span></span>And life's become a battle that you swore you'd never lose.<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>It don't matter what went wrong this time, don't matter what went right.
<br/><span></span>We're always searching for the reason why...
<br/><span></span>And the longest road to find it will take many years to climb.
<br/><span></span>Don't wait up for that moment to arrive...
<br/><span></span>Leave Them All Behind.<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>Well I'm tired of all the promises and never coming through.
<br/><span></span>It's easy to pretend until they turn their back on you.
<br/><span></span>And all the ones that bring you down, their colours weren't that true.
<br/><span></span>And when you lose your confidence your mind plays tricks on you.<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>It don't matter what went wrong this time, don't matter what went right.
<br/><span></span>We're always searching for the reason why...
<br/><span></span>And the longest road to find it will take many years to climb.
<br/><span></span>We keep on getting stuck here all the time.<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>We're gonna Leave Them All Behind.
<br/><span></span>We're gonna Leave Them All Behind.
<br/><span></span>We're gonna catch that train, the words they say couldn't stop us if they tried.
<br/><span></span>We're gonna Leave Them All Behind.
<br/><span></span>We're gonna Leave Them All Behind.
<br/><span></span>We're gonna catch that train I know some day everything's gonna fall in line.<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>I've been struck down and defeated every step along the way.
<br/><span></span>Become I'm your own worst enemy when nothing seems to change.
<br/><span></span>You have to fail a thousand times before you get it straight.
<br/><span></span>So catch me if you can 'cause I ain't leaving this to fate.<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>It don't matter what went wrong this time, don't matter what went right.
<br/><span></span>We're always searching for the reason why...
<br/><span></span>And the longest road to find it will take many years to climb.
<br/><span></span>We keep on getting stuck here all the time.<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>We're gonna leave them all behind!
<br/><span></span>We're gonna leave them all behind!
