<br/><span></span>a day that will live on in infamy.
<br/><span></span>President Kennedy was a-ridin' high,
<br/><span></span>good day to be livin' and a good day to die,
<br/><span></span>being led to the slaughter like a sacrificial lamb.
<br/><span></span>He said, "Wait a minute, boys, you know who I am?"
<br/><span></span>"Of course we do, we know who you are!"
<br/><span></span>Then they blew off his head while he was still in the car.<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>Shot down like a dog in broad daylight,
<br/><span></span>was a matter of timing and the timing was right.
<br/><span></span>You got unpaid debts, we've come to collect.
<br/><span></span>We're gonna kill you with hatred, without any respect.
<br/><span></span>We'll mock you and shock you and we'll put it in your face.
<br/><span></span>We've already got someone here
<br/><span></span>to take your place.<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>The day they blew out the brains of the king,
<br/><span></span>thousands were watching, no one saw a thing.
<br/><span></span>It happened so quickly, so quick, by surprise,
<br/><span></span>right there in front of everyone's eyes.
<br/><span></span>Greatest magic trick ever under the sun,
<br/><span></span>perfectly executed, skillfully done.
<br/><span></span>Wolfman, oh, Wolfman, oh, Wolfman, howl.
<br/><span></span>Rub-a-dub-dub, it's a murder most foul.<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>Hush, little children, you'll understand
<br/><span></span>The Beatles are comin', they're gonna hold your hand.
<br/><span></span>Slide down the banister, go get your coat,
<br/><span></span>ferry 'cross the Mersey and go for the throat.<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>There's three bums comin' all dressed in rags,
<br/><span></span>pick up the pieces and lower the flags.
<br/><span></span>I'm goin' to Woodstock, it's the Aquarian Age.
<br/><span></span>Then I'll go over to Altamont and sit near the stage.<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>Put your head out the window, let the good times roll.
<br/><span></span>There's a party going on behind the grassy knoll.
<br/><span></span>Stack up the bricks, pour the cement.
<br/><span></span>Don't say Dallas don't love you, Mr. President.<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>Put your foot in the tank and then step on the gas,
<br/><span></span>try to make it to the triple underpass.
<br/><span></span>Blackface singer, whiteface clown,
<br/><span></span>better not show your faces after the sun goes down.
<br/><span></span>Up in the red-light district, they've got cop on the beat
<br/><span></span>living in a nightmare on Elm Street.<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>When you're down on Deep Ellum,
<br/><span></span>put your money in your shoe.
<br/><span></span>Don't ask what your country can do for you.
<br/><span></span>Cash on the barrelhead, money to burn,
<br/><span></span>Dealey Plaza, make a left-hand turn.<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>I'm going down to the crossroads, gonna flag a ride,
<br/><span></span>the place where faith, hope, and charity died.
<br/><span></span>Shoot him while he runs, boy, shoot him while you can,
<br/><span></span>see if you can shoot the invisible man.
<br/><span></span>Goodbye, Charlie! Goodbye, Uncle Sam!
<br/><span></span>Frankly, Miss Scarlett, I don't give a damn.<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>What is the truth, where did it go?
<br/><span></span>Ask Oswald and Ruby, they oughta know.
<br/><span></span>"Shut your mouth," said a wise old owl.
<br/><span></span>Business is business, and it's a murder most foul<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>Tommy, can you hear me? I'm the Acid Queen.
<br/><span></span>I'm riding in a long, black Lincoln limousine,
<br/><span></span>ridin' in the back seat next to my wife,
<br/><span></span>headed straight on into the afterlife.
<br/><span></span>I'm leaning to the left, I got my head in her lap.
<br/><span></span>Hold on, I've been led into some kind of a trap
<br/><span></span>where we ask no quarter and no quarter do we give.
<br/><span></span>We're right down the street
<br/><span></span>from the street where you live.<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>They mutilated his body and they took out his brain.
<br/><span></span>What more could they do? They piled on the pain.
<br/><span></span>But his soul was not there where it was supposed to be at.
<br/><span></span>For the last fifty years, they've been searchin' for that.
<br/><span></span>Freedom, oh, freedom, freedom over me,
<br/><span></span>I hate to tell you, mister, but only dead men are free.
<br/><span></span>Send me some lovin', then tell me no lie.
<br/><span></span>Throw the gun in the gutter and walk on by.<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>Wake up, little Susie, let's go for a drive,
<br/><span></span>cross the Trinity River, let's keep hope alive.
<br/><span></span>Turn the radio on, don't touch the dials,
<br/><span></span>Parkland Hospital, only six more miles.
<br/><span></span>You got me dizzy, Miss Lizzy, you filled me with lead.
<br/><span></span>That magic bullet of yours has gone to my head.<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>I'm just a patsy like Patsy Cline,
<br/><span></span>never shot anyone from in front or behind.
<br/><span></span>I've blood in my eye, got blood in my ear,
<br/><span></span>I'm never gonna make it to the new frontier.<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>Zapruder's film I seen night before,
<br/><span></span>seen it thirty-three times, maybe more.
<br/><span></span>It's vile and deceitful, it's cruel and it's mean,
<br/><span></span>ugliest thing that you ever have seen.<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>They killed him once and they killed him twice,
<br/><span></span>killed him like a human sacrifice.
<br/><span></span>The day that they killed him, someone said to me,
<br/><span></span>"Son, the age of the Antichrist has just only begun."<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>Air Force One comin' in through the gate,
<br/><span></span>Johnson sworn in at 2:38.
<br/><span></span>Let me know when you decide to throw in the towel.
<br/><span></span>It is what it is, and it's murder most foul.<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>What's new, pussycat? What'd I say?
<br/><span></span>I said the soul of a nation been torn away
<br/><span></span>and it's beginning to go into a slow decay
<br/><span></span>and that it's thirty-six hours past Judgment Day.<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>Wolfman Jack, he's speaking in tongues,
