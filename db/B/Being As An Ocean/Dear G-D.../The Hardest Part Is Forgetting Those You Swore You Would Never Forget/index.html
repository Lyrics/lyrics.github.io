<title>Being As An Ocean â€“ The Hardest Part Is Forgetting Those You Swore You Would Never Forget | Lyrics</title>
<meta name="description" content="There sit two lovers / One&#x27;s eyes intently chasing the other&#x27;s / She doesn&#x27;t love him anymore / But he&#x27;ll stick it out till the end / This he had sworn / Lying awake in bed / Feeling the spot on my chest / Where you used"/>
