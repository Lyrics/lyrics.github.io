<br/><span></span>That informing power or spirit is God, and since nothing else that I see merely through the senses can or will persist, He alone is.
<br/><span></span>And is this power benevolent or malevolent?
<br/><span></span>I see it as purely benevolent.
<br/><span></span>For I can see, that in the midst of death, Life persists, in the midst of untruth, Truth persists, in the midst of darkness, Light persists.
<br/><span></span>Hence I gather, that God is Life, Truth, Light, He is Love.
<br/><span></span>He is the supreme good.
<br/><span></span>But He is no god who merely satisfies the intellect, if He ever does.
<br/><span></span>God to be God must rule the heart and transform it.
<br/><span></span>He must express Himself in every smallest act of His votary.
<br/><span></span>It is proved not by extraneous evidence, but in the transformed conduct and character of those who have felt the real presence of God within.
<br/><span></span>To reject this evidence is to deny oneself.
<br/><span></span>This realization is preceded by an immovable faith.
<br/><span></span>He who would, in his own person, test the fact of God's presence can do so by a living faith, and since faith itself cannot be proved by extraneous evidence, the safest course is to believe in...; the law of Truth and Love.
<br/><span></span>Exercise of faith will be the safest where there is a clear determination summarily to reject all that is contrary to Truth and Love.
<br/><span></span>I confess that I have no argument to convince through reason, faith transcends reason.
<br/><span></span>All that I can advise is not to attempt the impossible.<br/><span></span><br/><span></span><br/></div><hr/><table><tbody><tr><td>Song name&nbsp;</td><td>It's Really Not As Complicated As You're Making It Out to Be</td><tr><td>Artist&nbsp;</td><td>Being As An Ocean</td><tr><td>Album&nbsp;</td><td>Dear G-D...</td></tbody></table></div></div></div><script>var input=document.createElement("input");input.name="q";input.type="search";input.placeholder="Search";document.getElementsByTagName("nav")[0].appendChild(input)</script>
