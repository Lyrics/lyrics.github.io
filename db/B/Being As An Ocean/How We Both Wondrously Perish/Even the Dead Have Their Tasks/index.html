<title>Being As An Ocean â€“ Even the Dead Have Their Tasks | Lyrics</title>
<meta name="description" content="We pack up our gear / And we&#x27;re gone again / Driven by passion, outward / Away from family and friends / But what they can&#x27;t see / Is that every day I&#x27;m drowning in a sea / Of faces that I miss so desperately / With each"/>
