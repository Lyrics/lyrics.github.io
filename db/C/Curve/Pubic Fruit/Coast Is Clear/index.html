    <div class="view"><pre>Above my bed in this ugly room
Hangs the whisper of the same man.

You could be my father
For the love we've shown.
It's just a little too late,
It's never enough to swallow those pills.
Now I'm sick, and always will be.

Take it, I don't want it,
You can have what you like.
Just don't try to trick me to sleep,
Don't turn out those lights.

You could be my father
For the love we've shown.
It's just a little too late,
It's never enough to swallow those pills.
Now I'm sick, I always will be.

Dreams of meeting truth.
Be my father.
Dreams of meeting truth.
For the love.

I said
You could be my father
For the love we've shown.
It's just a little too late,
It's never enough to swallow those pills.
Now I'm sick, now I'm sick, now I'm sick.

Just when you thought it was all right.
Just when you thought it was all right.

Coast is clear
Coast is clear
Coast is clear
Coast is clear
Coast is clear
Coast is clear
Coast is clear
Coast is clear
