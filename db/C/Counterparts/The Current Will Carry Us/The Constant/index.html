Though I can't explain the path I've<span><br/></span>Chosen, all I know is I'm right where I need to be. And though I've turned down<span><br/></span>A chance at fame and fortune, I know that there is no greater payment than<span><br/></span>This. And I'm so fucking far from the life I'm supposed to lead, and the man<span><br/></span>I'm supposed to be and I couldn't be happier. And I will remain a constant, I<span><br/></span>Know where I stand, and I refuse to let their selfishness take control of who I<span><br/></span>Am. While I may die poor, at least my life had meaning, there's more to life<span><br/></span>Than living, and I truly feel alive. And I know that when I die, there will be<span><br/></span>Others who feel the same way ready to take my place. This is our song of<span><br/></span>Protest. I promise you that nothing is slowing us down. While I may die poor,<span><br/></span>At least my life had meaning, there's more to life than living and I truly feel<span><br/></span>Alive. And I know that when I die, there will be others who feel the same way<span><br/></span>Ready to take my place. I will laugh in the face of those who tell me<span><br/></span>Different. Even with both of my feet planted firmly on the ground, I am free to<span><br/></span>Move in my own direction. I will remain a constant. I know where I stand.<span><br/></span><br/><br/><br/><hr/><p>Name  The Constant<br/>Artist  Counterparts<br/>Album  The Current Will Carry Us</p></blockquote></div>
