    <div class="view"><pre>As time passes by
 I feel everything changing but me
 I will not feel the sting of defeat
 I've watched days become months
 become years
 and I've lost all faith in progression
 I will never allow myself to exchange all my morals for acceptance
 If this is truly where I belong
 I'll fucking be here until the end of time
 I've watched everyone around me jump ship
 and I hope they're left to sink
 The current will carry us
 I am proud of all that I've become
 and I'm well aware that I have steered myself in the right direction
 And life is your's to destroy
 I just can't respect your decision
 I would rather isolate myself than be a walking definition of travesty
 I watched you do away with everything
 I would love nothing more than to watch this world swallow you whole
 You were the catalyst for your downfall
 But where the rest have failed
 we are bound to succeed
 And mark my fucking words
 as long as we are breathing
 we will overcome
 The integrity that we emanate day-to-day is unparalleled
 and our efforts will not go unnoticed
 We will be remembered</pre></div>
