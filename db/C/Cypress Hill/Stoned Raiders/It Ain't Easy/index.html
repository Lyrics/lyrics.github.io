<br/><span></span>Times I had to get over the everyday shuffle
<br/><span></span>People tryin' to muffle my thoughts and all my dreams too
<br/><span></span>People who I thought were down, and see true
<br/><span></span>But I blame me too 'cos it's a Chronicle
<br/><span></span>My life, I realise I'm responsible for obstacles
<br/><span></span>In front of me, my own self to blame
<br/><span></span>But I worked hard to receive the wealth and fame
<br/><span></span>It's a worthless game, but if you're willing to play
<br/><span></span>There's sharks in the water who are, willing to pay
<br/><span></span>The price of your soul, but if you give it away
<br/><span></span>You silly motherfuckers are all commited to stay
<br/><span></span>It's a cold world, but you still want a part of it
<br/><span></span>So then you'd better fuck around and learn the art of it
<br/><span></span>Don't walk through life with your blinders on
<br/><span></span>'Cos you'll keep goin' crazy 'til your mind is gone<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>It Ain't Easy,
<br/><span></span>but you got people tryin', to put you down, believe me
<br/><span></span>I keep gainin' ground, It Ain't Easy

<br/><span></span>Cypress, is Worldwide and we like it that way
<br/><span></span>You can't fade-ER, or compare TO
<br/><span></span>The Original Pyscho-Baiter
<br/><span></span>Got the next rhyme and we'll check you all later
<br/><span></span>Can't nobody fuck with them Cypress Hill Raiders
<br/><span></span>Heard it all before and I don't need no more
<br/><span></span>Advice on the game and how to kick hardcore
<br/><span></span>Played the game out here with the best
<br/><span></span>Toured around the world and got big respect
<br/><span></span>Now, what's (?) all with this year 2000's?
<br/><span></span>We puttin the Smackdown and we ain't clownin'
<br/><span></span>Not many have lasted
<br/><span></span>Since we first blasted
<br/><span></span>Up on the scene, singin' about the dream
<br/><span></span>Recruitin' for our team, niggas know what I mean

<br/><span></span>How many times, must you decieve me?<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>Times I hated, times I waited
<br/><span></span>Times I went by where I was drunk and faded
<br/><span></span>They said I wouldn't make it, but where are those people now?
<br/><span></span>Still hatin', creatin' all the evil now
<br/><span></span>Your insecurties are showin', exposin' you
<br/><span></span>You're trippin' on me and showin' emotions too
<br/><span></span>Don't you spend your life full of envy, it's deadly
<br/><span></span>Heed me, as I spit the venom believe me<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>I keep my guard up, and always let you see my rage
<br/><span></span>I get pissed, like a pitbull in a cage (barking)
<br/><span></span>Not that many can deal with the fury
<br/><span></span>Attack and ransack and kill in a hurry
<br/><span></span>I kill and observe and go in an instant
<br/><span></span>I bring the pain like the ?Rampark? Prison
<br/><span></span>I kept it right for the brother to the ?Chullo?
