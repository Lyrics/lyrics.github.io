    <div class="view"><pre>Changing channels, watching the drama
Sit and fade while losing your karma
Day by day they feed your brain
Lay your thoughts in hidden dreams
Those who watch, or those who serve
I guess we get what we deserve

Spineless and faceless
Go fuck yourself
Don't ask why
Heartless and brainless
Go fuck yourself
You know why
Pointless and senseless
Go fuck yourself
Don't ask why
Aimless and faithless
Go fuck yourself
You know why

It's killing me
This war in my head
It's killing me
We can't break free
It's killing me
This war in my head
We can't break free

Consume the light, consume the lie
Forget the wold, forget your life
I cast a spell on you and everybody else
Who doesn't give a shit for someone else
The world around you is an ugly place
You're not gonna die with a smile on your face

Illness and sickness
Go fuck yourself
Dullness and darkness
Go fuck yourself

The virus is out and there is no escape
A silent killer is on his way
The virus is out to choke your brain
A silent killer is after you
It's all in vain (it's all in vain)

It's killing me
This war in my head
It's killing me
We can't break free
It's killing me
This war in my head
We can't break free

I don't wanna know about your madness
I don't wanna know about your low life existence
Broadcast to damnation</pre></div>
