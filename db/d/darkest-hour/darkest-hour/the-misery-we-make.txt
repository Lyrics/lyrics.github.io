Out of your life and into your mind
Dividing lines
Someone forgotten, something inside
somewhere in time

this lasting sight
never more than a sound
so vile and infectious
a lucid recount

And I'll never say
What you want me to say
When I tell you everything's going to fade
And I'll never be
What you want me to be
When I'm in the misery that we've made

The misery that we've made!

And when will I know?
And when will you tell me
What we already know?
This is all temporary

I. I was in doubt
ever you were around
Denial and acceptance with or without

And I'll never say
What you want me to say
When I tell you everything's
going to fade
And I'll never be
What you want me to be
When I'm in the misery
that we've made

When I'm in the misery!

And I'll never say
What you want me to say
When I tell you everything's going to fade
And I'll never be
What you want me to be
When I'm in the misery that we've made

Misery!

And I'll never be what you
want me to be
When I'm in the misery
