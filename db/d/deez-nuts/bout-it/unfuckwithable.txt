Say what you want about us, you can't doubt us
Fought every inch of an up hill battle and now look
Catch us in the clouds livin' the life we dreamed of
Chillin' how the gods chill with a chill demeanour

So kill the drama we done it, you can't debate it, we made it
I'm blowing kisses at bitches while we drink gin by the cases
Haters talk shit still 'till they get lock jaw
While we shoot the shit with legends of game so fuck y'all

We seen 'em come, we seen 'em go and all we know
We don't give a fuck, yo, we are unfuckwithable
We don't just shine we illuminate the whole show
Yeah, you know we are unfuckwithable

If you feelin' like I'm feelin' let me feel it when
I hear you, yo, let's go we are unfuckwithable

Yeah

So kill the bitchin' and listen, you can't deny we on fire
If your rebuttal is muddled, it's cause my IQ is higher
Be lying if I said I gave a fuck regardless, for every 1 that haten 100 adore us

We seen 'em come, we seen 'em go and all we know
We don't give a fuck, yo, we are unfuckwithable
We don't just shine we illuminate the whole show
Yeah, you know we are unfuckwithable

If you feelin' like I'm feelin' let me feel it when
I hear you, yo, let's go we are unfuckwithable

We are unfuckwithable

We are unfuckwithable

We are unfuckwithable

We are unfuckwithable

Unfuckwithable
