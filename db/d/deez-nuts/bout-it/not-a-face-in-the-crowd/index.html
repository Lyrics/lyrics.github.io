<meta name="description" content="This goes out to the ones, who paved the way for us to live the life that we love. / There's a place in my heart, for everyone of you that shows love and support / Not a day I don't count my blessings, for that chance I've been given and I know who's / Responsible everyone of you made us everything we are, and I know without you none / Of this shits possible. No matter what the fuck life throws at us, when we take the / Stage none of that shit matters. when we hear your voices when we feelin' that vibe / I know there's no place else I'd rather be or feel more alive / DN fam worldwide this one's for you / This one's for you / My DN fam / Home is where the heart is and I love this shit / DN fam worldwide this one's for you / This one's for you / My DN fam / Your not a face in the crowd you are a part of this / You keep me young and motivated, innovative, sober or faded for you we create it / I am a native anywhere my home you made it, I stay creative on a tear with this I state it / If you care then I care cause you made it, possible for me to stay rejuvenated, invigorated / Mind elevated feel loved not hated on stages where I demonstrate it / DN fam worldwide this one's for you / This one's for you / My DN fam / Home is where the heart is and I love this shit / DN fam worldwide this one's for you / This one's for you / My DN fam / Your not a face in the crowd you are a part of this / This Mic, this stage, this time, this song is yours / Your not a face in the crowd you are a part of this / So now's the time to show us what you got / And let me see you throw your hands up if you believe this shit / This Mic, this stage, this time, this song is yours / Your not a face in the crowd you are a part of this / So now's the time to show us what you got / And let me see you throw your hands up if you believe this shit / _____________________________ / Name Not A Face In The Crowd / Artist Deez Nuts / Album Bout It"/>
