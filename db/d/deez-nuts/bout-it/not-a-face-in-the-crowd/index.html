There's a place in my heart, for everyone of you that shows love and support
Not a day I don't count my blessings, for that chance I've been given and I know who's
Responsible everyone of you made us everything we are, and I know without you none
Of this shits possible. No matter what the fuck life throws at us, when we take the
Stage none of that shit matters. when we hear your voices when we feelin' that vibe
I know there's no place else I'd rather be or feel more alive

DN fam worldwide this one's for you
This one's for you
My DN fam

Home is where the heart is and I love this shit

DN fam worldwide this one's for you
This one's for you
My DN fam

Your not a face in the crowd you are a part of this


You keep me young and motivated, innovative, sober or faded for you we create it
I am a native anywhere my home you made it, I stay creative on a tear with this I state it
If you care then I care cause you made it, possible for me to stay rejuvenated, invigorated
Mind elevated feel loved not hated on stages where I demonstrate it

DN fam worldwide this one's for you
This one's for you
My DN fam

Home is where the heart is and I love this shit


DN fam worldwide this one's for you
This one's for you
My DN fam

Your not a face in the crowd you are a part of this

This Mic, this stage, this time, this song is yours
Your not a face in the crowd you are a part of this
So now's the time to show us what you got
And let me see you throw your hands up if you believe this shit


This Mic, this stage, this time, this song is yours
Your not a face in the crowd you are a part of this
So now's the time to show us what you got
And let me see you throw your hands up if you believe this shit</div></div>
