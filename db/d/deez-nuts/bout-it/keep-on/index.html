<title>Deez Nuts â€“ Keep On | Lyrics</title>
<meta name="description" content="Again and again and again I get tested / Feels like the walls are closing in I can't escape it / It's everywhere I turn so I can't run from it / So many things I see make me sick to my stomach / Feel compassion and pain look at the world with disdain / But know that I'm part of the problem and it drives me insane / I see no light at the end of the tunnel / So I take no solace in a bullshit empty promise / So what the fuck am I supposed to do / But live like I got nothing left to lose / Again and again and again there's no end / To the bullshit and the drama and the fake fucking friends / It's me against the world I've made my peace with that / But fighting through this life alone I find no peace in that / Day after day I get more disillusioned / With every fuckin' person on earth myself included / Everybody's got there demons to battle / I just don't know how much more of this shit I can handle / I feel the weight of the world and the pressures so great / I can feel my heart break every step that I take / But I keep on yeah I gotta be strong / Gotta make my momma proud, I gotta be my father's son / I keep on / I keep on / I keep on / _____________ / Name Keep On / Artist Deez Nuts / Album Bout It"/>
