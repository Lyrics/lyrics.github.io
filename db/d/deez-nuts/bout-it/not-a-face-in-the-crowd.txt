This goes out to the ones, who paved the way for us to live the life that we love.
There's a place in my heart, for everyone of you that shows love and support
Not a day I don't count my blessings, for that chance I've been given and I know who's
Responsible everyone of you made us everything we are, and I know without you none
Of this shits possible. No matter what the fuck life throws at us, when we take the
Stage none of that shit matters. when we hear your voices when we feelin' that vibe
I know there's no place else I'd rather be or feel more alive

You keep me young and motivated, innovative, sober or faded for you we create it
I am a native anywhere my home you made it, I stay creative on a tear with this I state it
If you care then I care cause you made it, possible for me to stay rejuvenated, invigorated
Mind elevated feel loved not hated on stages where I demonstrate it
