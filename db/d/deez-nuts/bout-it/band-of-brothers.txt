i've got my band of brothers, and were taken to the streets
if we don't wake up tomorrow, its cause we drink till dawn we aint trying to sleep
you'll never take this away from us, cause we don't give a fuck, throw caution to the wind.
we all know the best part of it, tomorrow night, we'll do it all again.
2x

now's the time, we all looking for the time of our life
we all feelin it so i guess that tonight is the night
at it again, pick your poison get it in.
no fuckin around, we gotta do this right.

grab your weed, smoke till your eyes bleed
drop anything you've got, drink everything in sight
grab a pack, smoke till your lungs black
and chop it up, with the ones you love, till the day light.

drop anything you've got, drink everything in sight
grab a pack, smoke till your lungs black
and chop it up, with the ones you love, till the day light.
