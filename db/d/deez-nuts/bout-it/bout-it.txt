Yo, you know who the fuck it is, so introductions ain't necessary
stick tight to our kind, middle fingers to our adversaries
We on the grind 24/7 365, party like there's no tomorrow living like we born to die
but we got a whole lot left in us, and we can't stop won't stop while there's breath in us
No choice in the matter yo the game needs us, simple the fact of
the matter no one does it like does. Plus you know we do our thing cause you seen us put
it down in your country, in your city, your motherfuckin' town
we keeps it world wide like live wire to empire, keep it DTD from MLB to NYC
