Back once again sipping hen mixed with juice and gin
Motherfucker we about it, if you doubt it think again
We ain't tryina have a little sniff just a sip
Want cocaine pouring out my pores liquor out my dick
Yeah we talk the talk cause we walk the walk
Till we all slurring our words or 'til we stumble and fall
But you won't catch us slipping often
Shit we do this every day, no play, real talking

Kid you wanna know about the life we live?
Well listen up close cause it goes like this

We live a life of excess, shit that's all that we know
So don't take us to the bar if you ain't got the dough
Don't bring your girl around me if that bitch is a hoe
Don't bring your weed around them if you ain't gonna smoke

Cause we drink
Shot after shot after shot after shot
And we smoke
Blunt after blunt after blunt after blunt
Cause we drink
Shot after shot after shot after shot
And we smoke
Blunt after blunt after blunt after blunt

Yeah we talk the talk cause we walk the walk
Till we all slurring our words or 'til we stumble and fall
But you won't catch us slipping often
Shit we do this every day, no play, real talking

Kid you wanna know about the life we live?
Well listen up close cause it goes like this

We live a life of excess, shit that's all that we know
So don't take us to the bar if you ain't got the dough
Don't bring your girl around me if that bitch is a hoe
Don't bring your weed around them if you ain't gonna smoke

Drunk 'til death, you can't do it like us

What you drinking, what you smoking
Give me everything you're holding
What you drinking, what you smoking
Give us everything

Cause we drink
Shot after shot after shot after shot
And we smoke
Blunt after blunt after blunt after blunt
Cause we drink
Shot after shot after shot after shot
And we smoke
Blunt after blunt after blunt after blunt

Drunk 'til death, you can't do it like us
