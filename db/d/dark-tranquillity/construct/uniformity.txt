It all comes out
In desire we forgot to face
Take down ambition
Or in our minds we will always fail

The faceless remember
The Hours and the fallen words
Connect the fallacies
Detect autonomy
There is a limit
To the never ending sky

We must come to terms
Admit we are defeated
We must come to terms
With bias and deception
Stand up and be counted
In uniformity

It sets a high mark
For what our minds can endure

Is there life in the distance
A faint beacon of light
Let us fall to the inner ceiling
Of everything we see

The endless resistance
Decides upon the fallen words
Direct the agony to a non-response
And forgiveness to an idealized mirage

It informs all decisions
And challanges us to dare
