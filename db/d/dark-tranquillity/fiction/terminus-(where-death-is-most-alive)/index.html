<title>Dark Tranquillity â€“ Terminus (where Death Is Most Alive) | Lyrics</title>
<meta name="description" content="This is a ghost town, alive with the echoes of failures fled / Lit up by shining faces that parade these streets / What used to be of humility is gone / You walk the mounds of skull and bones / Where living is denied, I see more movement in decomposition than in those hollow eyes / It is the only place I know, where death is most alive / It is when truth is turned to lie, that death is most alive / Set flame to the ensnarers and pierce that ornate shield / Branded by what claims you, you wear the mark of death / Tear from loss and agony, a character defined / Stripped of all but tragedy, what life is left to find? / Go now, until there's nothing left / Go now, the dying has begun / It is the only place I know, where death is most alive / It is when truth is turned to lie, that death is most alive / So I flee from all that is me to hide behind this pale dead face / Whatever happened to desire, want and need? / Whatever happened to integrity? / Imagination is a curse in all of this / Whatever happened to the ones left behind? / This is a ghost town, our bodies dragged through endless streets / Go now, to never return / I've seen more pitiful humiliation than you could never hide / It is the only place I know, where death is most alive / It is when truth is turned to lie, that death is most alive / __________________________________________ / Name Terminus (where Death Is Most Alive) / Artist Dark Tranquillity / Album Fiction"/>
