Here come Johnny singing oldies, goldies
Be-Bop-A-Lula, Baby What I Say
Here come Johnny singing I Gotta Woman
Down in the tunnel trying to make it pay
He got the action, he got the motion
Oh yeah the boy can play
A dedication, devotion
Turning all the night time into the day

He do the song about the sweet lovin' woman
He do the song about the knife
And he do the walk, he do the walk of life
Yeah, he do the walk of life

Here comes Johnny gonna tell you the story
Hand me down my walkin' shoes
Here come Johnny with the power and the glory
Backbeat the talkin' blues
He got the action, he got the motion
Oh yeah the boy can play
A dedication, devotion
Turning all the night time into the day

He do the song about the sweet lovin' woman
He do the song about the knife
Then he do the walk, he do the walk of life
Yeah, he do the walk of life

Here come Johnny singing oldies, goldies
Be-Bop-A-Lula, Baby What I Say
Here come Johnny singing I Gotta Woman
Down in the tunnel, trying to make it pay
He got the action, he got the motion
Oh yeah the boy can play
A dedication, devotion
Turning all the night time into the day

And after all the violence and double talk
There's just a song in all the trouble and the strife
You do the walk, yeah, you do the walk of life
Mm, you do the walk of life
