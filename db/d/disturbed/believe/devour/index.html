<title>Disturbed â€“ Devour | Lyrics</title>
<meta name="description" content="Still enough / Although I know you're not begging / Still as the thoughts running through your mind / Still enough / Although I know you're not begging / Give me a reason to make you mine / I will devour you / Take all the pain away / I cannot stay my hand / From reaching out so that I can / Empower you / For all eternity / It seems to ease my mind / To know that you've brought / Meaning to my life / Had enough / Although I see you're not running / Still are the thoughts running through your mind / Dead to love / The path that you are now taking / Show me the reason to make you mine / I will devour you / Take all the pain away / I cannot stay my hand / From reaching out so that I can / Empower you / For all eternity / It seems to ease my mind / To know that you've brought / Meaning to my life / Run to where the smallest ray of light will never find you / Run to where you will not need to shield your eyes / Run away from all the soulless, heartless fiends who hound you / Run away and let your memories go blind / When I devour you / Take all the pain away / I cannot stay my hand / From reaching out so that I can / Empower you / For all eternity / It seems to ease my mind / To know that you've brought / Meaning to my life / ____________ / Name Devour / Artist Disturbed / Album Believe / Original text by Dan Donegan, David Draiman, / Michael Wengren, Mike Wengren, Steve Kmak / Copyright Warner/Chappell Music, Inc"/>
