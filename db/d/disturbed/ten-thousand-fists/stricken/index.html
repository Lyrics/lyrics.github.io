<title>Disturbed â€“ Stricken | Lyrics</title>
<meta name="description" content="You walk on like a woman in suffering / Won't even bother now to tell me why / You come alone, letting all of us savor the moment / Leaving me broken another time / You come on like a bloodstained hurricane / Leave me alone, let me be this time / You carry on like a holy man pushing redemption / I don't want to mention, the reason I know / That I am stricken and can't let you go / When the heart is cold, there's no hope, and we know / That I am crippled by all that you've done / Into the abyss will I run / You don't know what your power has done to me / I want to know if I'll heal inside / I can't go on with a holocaust about to happen / Seeing you laughing another time / You'll never know why your face has haunted me / My very soul has to bleed this time / Another hole in the wall of my inner defenses / Leaving me breathless, the reason I know / That I am stricken and can't let you go / When the heart is cold, there's no hope, and we know / That I am crippled by all that you've done / Into the abyss will I run / Into the abyss will I run / You walk on like a woman in suffering / Won't even bother now to tell me why / You come alone, letting all of us savor the moment / Leaving me broken another time / You come on like a bloodstained hurricane / Leave me alone, let me be this time / You carry on like a holy man pushing redemption / I don't want to mention, the reason I know / That I am stricken and can't let you go / When the heart is cold, there's no hope, and we know / That I am crippled by all that you've done / Into the abyss will I run / Into the abyss will I run / I can't let you go / Yes I am stricken and can't let you go / ______________ / Name Stricken / Artist Disturbed / Album Ten Thousand Fists"/>
