<div><pre>I. Someone Like Him
I never wanted to become someone like him so secure
Content to live each day just like the last
I was sure I knew that
This was not for me
And I wanted so much more
Far beyond what I could see
So I swore that I'd
Never be someone like him

So many years have passed
Since I proclaimed
My independence
My mission
My aim
And my vision
So secure
Content to live each day like it's my last
It's wonderful to know
That I could be
Something more than what I dreamed
Far beyond what I could see
Still I swear that I'm
Missing out this time

As far as I could tell
There's nothing more I need
But still I ask myself
Could this be everything
Then all I swore
That I would never be was now
So suddenly
The only thing
I wanted
To become
To be someone just like him

II. Medicate (Awakening)

A Doctor sitting next to me
He asks me how I feel
Not sure I understand his questioning
He says I've been away a while
But thinks he has cured me
From a state of catatonic sleep

For 30 years
Where have I been
Eyes open
But not getting through to me

Medicate me
Infiltrate me
Side effects appear
As my conscience slips away

Medicate me
Science failing
Conscience fading fast
Can't you stop what's happening

A higher dosage she prescribes
But there's no guarantee
I feel it starting to take over me
I tell him not to be ashamed
There's no one who's to blame
A second shot
A brief awakening

I feel the relapse
Can't break free
Eyes open
But not getting through to me

Medicate me
Infiltrate me
Side effects appear
As my conscience slips away

Medicate me
Science failing
Conscience fading fast
Can't you stop what's happening

III. Full Circle



Sailing on the seven seize the day tripper diem's ready
Jack the Ripper Owens Wilson Phillips and my supper's ready
Lucy in the sky with Diamond Dave's not here I come to save the
Day for Nightmare Cinema show me the way to get back home again

(Running forward, falling back)
Spinning round and round
(Looking outward, reaching in)
Scream without a sound
(Leaning over, crawling up)
Stumbling all around
(Losing my place, only to)
Find I've come full circle

Flying off the handle with careful with
That axe Eugene Gene the dance machine
Messiah light my fire gabba gabba
Hey hey my my generation's home again

(Running forward, falling back)
Spinning round and round
(Looking outward, reaching in)
Scream without a sound
(Leaning over, crawling up)
Stumbling all around
(Losing my place, only to)
Find I've come full circle

IV. Intervals

 Our deadly sins feel his mortal wrath
Remove all obstacles from our path

 Asking questions
Search for clues
The answer's been right in front of you

 Try to break through
Long to connect
Fall on deaf ears and failed muted breath

 Loyalty, trust, faith and desire
Carries love through each darkest fire

 Tortured insanity
A smothering hell
Try to escape but to no avail

 The calls of admirers
Who claim they adore
Drain all your lifeblood while begging for more

 Innocent victims of merciless crimes
Fall prey to some madman's impulsive designs

 Step after step
We try controlling our fate
When we finally start living it has become too late

Trapped inside this Octavarium
Trapped inside this Octavarium
Trapped inside this Octavarium
Trapped inside this Octavarium

V. Razor's Edge

We move in circles
Balanced all the while
On a gleaming razor's edge

A perfect sphere
Colliding with our fate
This story ends where it began</pre></div>
