(Chino)
Here I lay

(Maynard)
Still and breathless

(Chino)
Just like always

(Maynard)
Still I want some more

(Chino)
Mirrors sideways

(Maynard)
Who cares what's behind

(Chino)
Just like always

(Maynard)
Still your passenger

The chrome buttons, buckles on
Leather surfaces
These and other
Lucky witnesses

(Chino)
Now to calm me

(Maynard)
This time won't you please
Drive faster

Roll the window down
This cool night air is curious
Let the whole world look in
Who cares who sees anything?
I'm your passenger
I'm your passenger

(Chino)
Drop these down
Then put them on me
Nice cool seats there
To cushion your knees
Now to calm me

(Maynard)
Take me around again

(Chino)
Don't pull over

(Maynard)
This time won't you please
Drive faster

Roll the window down
This cool night air is curious
Let the whole world look in
Who cares who sees what tonight?
Roll these misty windows
Down to catch my breath again
Go and go and don't just
Drive me home then back again

(Chino)
Here I lay
Just like always

(Maynard)
Don't let me go
Go, go, go, go
Go, go, go, go
Take me to the end
