    <div class="view"><pre>I watched you change
Into a fly
I looked away
You were on fire

And I watched a change in you
It's like you never had wings
Now you feel so alive
I've watched you change

I took you home
Set you on the glass
I pulled off your wings
Then I laughed

And I watched a change in you
It's like you never had wings
Now you feel so alive
I watched you change

It's like you never had wings

Anh, ahah
Anh, ahah
Anh, ahah
Anh, ahah
Anh, ahah

I look at the cross
And I look away
Give you the gun
Blow me away

And I watched a change in you
It's like you never had wings
Now you feel so alive
I've watched you change

Now you feel alive
You feel alive
You feel alive
I've watched you change

It's like you never had wings

Anh, ahah
Anh, ahah
Anh, ahah
Anh, ahah
Anh, ahah

You've changed
You've changed
You've changed
You've changed</pre></div>
