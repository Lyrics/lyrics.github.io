We must play our lives like soldiers in the field
But life is short i'm running faster all the time
Strength and beauty destined to decay
So cut the rose in full bloom

'til the fearless come and the act is done
A love like blood, a love like blood
'til the fearless come and the act is done
A love like blood, a love like blood

We must dream of promised lands and fields
That never change in season
As we move towards no end we learn to die
Red tears are shed on grey

'til the fearless come and the act is done
A love like blood, a love like blood
'til the fearless come and the act is done
A love like blood, a love like blood

'til the fearless come and the act is done
A love like blood, a love like blood
'til the fearless come and the act is done
A love like blood, a love like blood
