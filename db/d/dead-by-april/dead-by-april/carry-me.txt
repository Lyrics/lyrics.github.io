I am still alone
Turn into stone,
Where did you go?
What did you find?
Where did all
This come to an end?

Carry me
Embrace me
What all we now lose
This is not true
Carry me

Do you see me
(Do you see me)
As I see you?
So many tears
In me have fallen
So many steps
I have been crawling

Carry me
Embrace me
What all we now lose
This is not true
I am falling, falling
I am falling
I am crawling, crawling
I am falling, falling
I am falling
I am crawling, crawling

I have a pain of this
I am falling and I can't hear the truth
I'm in distrust
You are in my dreams and I just can't hear the truth

Carry me
Embrace me
What all we now lose
This is not true
I am falling, falling
(I have a pain of this
I am falling and I can't hear the truth)
I am falling, falling
(I'm in distrust
You are in my dreams and I just can't hear the truth)
I am falling, (falling) falling
I am crawling
