Here is no one left to trust
Raise a light, one that I can see
Now reverse this enormous pain for this life to remain
I am walking through, watching what's left

Hold me close

This is what I see; emptiness in me
This is how I feel; this is what is real
I can't move back what is now fading black
I can't replace what is being erased

I crawl my way through every day
Raise your light, one that glows for me
Give me a sign, light my path, take me higher
I am walking through fire
Standing alone, abandoned to fate

Walk me through

This is what I see; emptiness in me
This is how I feel; this is what is real
I can't move back what is now fading black
I can't replace what is being, being erased

Being erased

Is this all that is left for me?

Hold me close

This is what I see; emptiness in me
This is how I feel; this is what is real
I can't move back what is now fading black
I can't replace what is being erased

This is what I see; emptiness in me
This is how I feel; this is what is real
I can't move back what is now fading black
I can't replace what is being erased
