I'm fading to gray, losing all track of time
I died in your own storm
I'm shattered in pieces
Lift up my eyes, I am falling too far

I open my heart for you

Now I'm being something I'm not
Memories gone, I'm falling behind
Now I'm standing, lonely in tears
My heart is gone, I'm falling behind

I'm fading away, I lose in the end (I lose in the end)
A reason to be, find me a miracle
Free my life from destruction
What am I worth now?
My happy ending long gone

I open my heart for you

Now I'm being something I'm not
Memories gone, I'm falling behind
Now I'm standing, lonely in tears
My heart is gone, I'm falling behind

(I never felt so alone) There's no turning back
(Forgiveness is long gone) I'm falling behind
(I never felt so closed) The legions are winning
(I'm falling behind) I'm losing my worth now
(I'm falling behind) My life becomes lifeless
(I'm falling behind)

Standing, lonely in tears
My heart is gone, I'm falling behind

Now I'm being something I'm not
Memories gone, I'm falling behind
Now I'm standing, lonely in tears
My heart is gone, I'm falling behind

Now I'm being something I'm not (Something I'm not)
Memories gone, I'm falling behind (Falling behind)
Now I'm standing, lonely in tears (Lonely in tears)
My heart is gone, I'm falling behind
