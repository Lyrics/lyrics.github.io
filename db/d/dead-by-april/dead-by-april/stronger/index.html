    <div class="view"><pre>For so many years I've tried to complete
What I once started
But something was always here holding me back from it
Kept me from making it happen
It's so unreal
The clock is ticking, the time is passing me by
Passing me by

Everywhere (Everywhere)
All that is near
Now it's time, to show them all
What I am, who I am, what I think

Anwser me it's all that I'm asking
Taking back what I've been missing
Looking back making me stronger
My despair plagues me no longer
My despair

So it seems tat I've found my escape out from your prison
I am once again myself, stronger than ever
Feeling so free, feeling secure
Nothing can get me now, nothing at all
Feeling alive, it took me longer than I ever expected

Everywhere (Everywhere)
All that is near
Now it's time, to show them all
What I am, who I am, what I think

Anwser me it's all that I'm asking
Taking back what I've been missing
Looking back making me stronger
My despair plagues me no longer

Everywhere (Everywhere)
All that is near
Everywhere (Everywhere)
All that is near

Anwser me it's all that I'm asking
Taking back what I've been missing
Looking back making me stronger
My despair plagues me no longer
My despair
Oooh
My despair</pre></div>
