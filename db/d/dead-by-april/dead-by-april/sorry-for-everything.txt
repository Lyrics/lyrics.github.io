Sometimes you've said I didn't listen to your words
That I even made you cry
Maybe I didn't show in every possible way (Possible way)
How much I cared

I'm sorry for not being myself
For everything ending this way
Maybe I, maybe you could need this change
I'm sorry for, for everything

I wish that I could stop your tears from falling down
Probably, I'd make it worse
Maybe I wasn't always there, it doesn't mean I don't care
Whatever it was

I'm sorry for not being myself
For everything ending this way
Maybe I, maybe you could need this change
I'm sorry for, for everything

We're minutes away from saying goodbye for all of time
I'm seconds away from breakin' apart

I'm sorry for, for everything

(I'm sorry for not being myself)
For everything ending this way
Maybe I, maybe you (Maybe me)
Could need this change
I'm sorry for (I'm sorry for everything)
For everything (For everything)
