    <div class="view"><pre>I tried to be all that you need
Tried not ever let you down
Still I can see it in your eyes
Not good enough

This time I believed that I really could change
I gave it all
This time you really had my everything
I guess I was wrong

(I guess I was wrong)

What can I say, what can I do?
This is who I am and I'm hurting you
What can I say, what can I do?
No matter how strong my feelings are
I always end up hurting you
I always end up hurting you

I'm hurting you

I tried hard only to be him
You've always wanted in life
Still I just bring you misery
What can I do?

This time I believed in you, in me
And I gave it all
This time I could see it all perfectly
I guess I was wrong

(I guess I was wrong)

What can I say, what can I do?
This is who I am and I'm hurting you
What can I say, what can I do?
No matter how strong my feelings are
I always end up hurting you
I always end up hurting you

Without you I am crying
With you I am just hurting you
Without you I am dying
With you I am tearing your heart

Without you I am crying
Without you I am dying

What can I say, what can I do?
This is who I am and I'm hurting you
What can I say, what can I do?
No matter how strong my feelings are
I always end up hurting you
(I always end up hurting you)
I always end up hurting you

I'm hurting you</pre></div>
