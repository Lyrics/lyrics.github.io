What I have in me, in my mind is you
I would die if we were through
What I'm feeling now, what I'm heading into
I am lost in pain without you

So cold, so alone

All I have is you, it is all that I'm breathing for
All I need is you, now I can't make it through

All the nights I've prayed, must this all be untrue?
I am not prepared to be strong
I just can't believe I am losing you
Unprepared to carry on
I can't see you walk away

So cold, so alone

All I have is you, it is all that I'm breathing for
All I need is you, now I can't make it through
I am losing you forever, I am lost in pain without you
I am leaving ground forever (Forever)

Distant, so far, destiny is selecting me
I can't be strong, life is disconnecting me
Now, loneliness infecting me
Gone are the days you were there protecting me

So cold, so alone

All I have is you, it is all that I'm breathing for
All I need is you, now I can't make it through
I am losing you forever, I am lost in pain without you
I am leaving ground forever (Forever)

All I have is you, it is all that I'm breathing for
All I need is you, now I can't make it through

(It is all that I'm breathing for, breathing for, breathing for)

(Breathing for, breathing for, breathing for)
