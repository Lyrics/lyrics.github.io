<title>Dead by April â€“ In My Arms | Lyrics</title>
<meta name="description" content="Don't look down, don't look back, I am beside you / Close your eyes, know I'm here (Here) / I know it's hard to let go all that defines you / You feel like you'll never be whole again / We will find a way to erase the past / Stay with me, stay with me / In my arms you'll be fine, I'll never let go / All you've lost will come again, just stay here with me / Never look back, never again, it's over / Everything ends here in my arms / Don't give in, don't let your memories break you / Let me take you away from here (Here) / We will find a way to make this last / Stay with me, stay with me / In my arms you'll be fine, I'll never let go / All you've lost will come again, just stay here with me / Never look back, never again, it's over / Everything ends here in my arms / I'll be here forever / Everything ends here in my arms / I'll be here forever / Everything ends in my arms / I'll be here forever, forever / Forever / In my arms (In my arms) / You'll be fine (You'll be fine) / I'll never let go / All you've lost (All you've lost) / Will come again (Will come again) / Just stay here with me / Never look back (Never look back) / Never again (Never again) / It's over / Everything ends here in my arms / ________________ / Name In My Arms / Artist Dead by April / Album Dead by April"/>
