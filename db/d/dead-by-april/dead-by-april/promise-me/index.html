<meta name="description" content="Into the fire on my own, ...hey / I know I won't see your face again, ...hey / Are you sitting there alone, ...hey-ey / Are you thinking like me, of the laughing times, / of all the sad and loving times? / everything that's left of us / is fading away / Promise me to think of us, as a time so wonderful / Promise me to think of us, still bright, still colourful / Promise me to look back at us, as a time in your life, you enjoyed / Surrounded by flames everywhere, / what I used to be, I'm not even there / The absence of you is killing me, ...hey-ey, / Are you thinking like me, of the laughing times, / of all the sad and loving times? / everything that's left of us / is fading away / Promise me to think of us, as a time so wonderful / Promise me to think of us, still bright, still colourful / Promise me to look back at us, as a time in your life, you enjoyed / ...Promise me, promise me... / I will be fine without you, / ...Promise me, promise me... / Once more in my life to see you / ...Promise me, promise me... / I will be fine without you / ...Promise me, promise me... / Once more in my life to see you / Can you promise me? / to see you / Can you promise me? / Promise me to think of us, as a time so wonderful ...so wonderful / Promise me to think of us, still bright, still colourful ...still colourful / Promise me to look back at us, as a time in your life, you enjoyed / Promise me to think of us, as a time so wonderful ...so wonderful / Promise me to think of us, still bright, still colourful ...still colourful / ________________ / Name Promise Me / Artist Dead by April / Album Dead by April"/>
