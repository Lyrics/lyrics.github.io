<div><pre>Into the fire on my own, ...hey
I know I won't see your face again, ...hey
Are you sitting there alone, ...hey-ey
Are you thinking like me, of the laughing times,
of all the sad and loving times?
everything that's left of us
is fading away

Promise me to think of us, as a time so wonderful
Promise me to think of us, still bright, still colourful
Promise me to look back at us, as a time in your life, you enjoyed

Surrounded by flames everywhere,
what I used to be, I'm not even there
The absence of you is killing me, ...hey-ey,
Are you thinking like me, of the laughing times,
of all the sad and loving times?
everything that's left of us
is fading away

Promise me to think of us, as a time so wonderful
Promise me to think of us, still bright, still colourful
Promise me to look back at us, as a time in your life, you enjoyed

...Promise me, promise me...
I will be fine without you,
...Promise me, promise me...
Once more in my life to see you
...Promise me, promise me...
I will be fine without you
...Promise me, promise me...
Once more in my life to see you

Can you promise me?
to see you
Can you promise me?

Promise me to think of us, as a time so wonderful ...so wonderful
Promise me to think of us, still bright, still colourful ...still colourful
Promise me to look back at us, as a time in your life, you enjoyed

Promise me to think of us, as a time so wonderful ...so wonderful
Promise me to think of us, still bright, still colourful ...still colourful</pre></div>
