You should know
You should know

Don't tell me to let go the past
'Cause it's all I've got
Though it all went too fast, memories will last

For what's wrong I apologize
Trying to go on with a broken heart
I thought it through like a thousand times
What went wrong, what went wrong?

I am trying so hard

You should know
I am falling to pieces without you here
You should know
I'm not able to go on without you here

I want you to know
Try to breathe, try to sleep, try to feel
But without you here
I cannot breathe, cannot sleep, cannot feel
Not without you here

Don't tell me to, to let go of you
It hurts in me, say that it's not too late
That it's just a dream

From the bottom of my heart, I'm sorry
Trying to go on with a broken heart
Can't get closure inside of this story
What went wrong, what went wrong?

I am trying so hard

You should know
I am falling to pieces without you here
You should know
I'm not able to go on without you here

I want you to know
Try to breathe, try to sleep, try to feel
But without you here
I cannot breathe, cannot sleep, cannot feel
Not without you here

All the memories still remain
I think of them again and again
My abilities are restrained
Can't get rid of you and the pain

(I want you to know, I thought you should know)

(I am trying so hard)

You should know
I am falling to pieces without you here
You should know
I'm not able to go on without you here

I want you to know
Try to breathe (Try to breathe)
Try to sleep (Try to sleep)
Try to feel
But without you here
I cannot breathe (Cannot breathe)
Cannot sleep (Cannot sleep)
Cannot feel
Not without you here
