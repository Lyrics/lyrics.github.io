It's a new day (New day, new day)
Something feels strange
I'm walking in the clouds
I'm almost touching the stars
Anything seems possible, imaginable

Am I dreamin'? (Dreamin', dreamin')
All normal things start to change
Can feel no gravity
I step outside the atmosphere
Nothing seems impossible, unreachable

How strange it feels, moving in slow motion
I guess I must be dreamin'
Now, is this real or my imagination?
I guess I must be dreamin'
Dreamin', dreamin', dreamin', dreamin'
I guess I must be dreamin'
Dreamin', dreamin', dreamin', dreamin'

I take a leap (A leap, a leap)
I should be scared, but I'm not
Traveling at the speed of light
Planets are flashing by
Like a shooting star I fly

How strange it feels, moving in slow motion
I guess I must be dreamin'
Now, is this real or my imagination?
I guess I must be dreamin'
Dreamin', dreamin', dreamin', dreamin'
I guess I must be dreamin'
Dreamin', dreamin', dreamin', dreamin'

This is just a dream
This is just a dream

How strange it feels, moving in slow motion
I guess I must be dreamin'
Now, is this real or my imagination?
I guess I must be dreamin'
Dreamin', dreamin', dreamin', dreamin'
I guess I must be dreamin'
Dreamin', dreamin', dreamin', dreamin'
