<title>Dead by April â€“ Within My Heart | Lyrics</title>
<meta name="description" content="You remember me, you remember us / It was magical when I felt your touch / It's a strong memory still today / It feels so good with your body close / Those days are gone, time flies away / But it's what I'm dreaming of still today / I'm sad to see that this was all we had / But within my heart, you'll have a place deep within my heart / A special place for you no matter what was said and done / Within my heart, you'll always be inside my heart as long as I live / Every little beat within my heart is still beating for us / Every little piece of my heart is still longing for us / I am not strong enough, I know, I cannot ever let you go / Within my heart, within my heart / (Within my heart, within my heart) / Within my heart, within my heart / Within my heart / What once was strong and filled with passion / Has withered away and turned to nothing / But you're all I'm dreaming of still today / It's sad that what we had is dead and gone / But within my heart, you'll have a place within my heart / A special place forever, no matter what happened / You have a place in my heart, within my heart for eternity / Every little beat within my heart is still beating for us / Every little piece of my heart is still longing for us / I am not strong enough, I know, I cannot ever let you go / Within my heart, within my heart / (Within my heart, within my heart) / Within my heart, within my heart / Every night I have this dream / Will I find the right way back again into your open arms? / Every night you're in my dreams / And I know that we will meet again / It's written in the stars and within my heart / Every little beat within my heart is still beating for us / Every little piece of my heart is still longing for us / I am not strong enough, I know, I cannot ever let you go / Within my heart, within my heart / Within my heart, within my heart / _____________________ / Name Within My Heart / Artist Dead by April / Album Incomparable"/>
