    <div class="view"><pre>I picture you now right in front of me
Your beautiful eyes looking right at me
Remember the warmth you used to give me
I wish I could bring it back, wish I could take it back

Never thought it existed, never thought it could be
The second I saw you, something changed in me
My feelings flowered up, they came naturally
Something changed in me

Can you hear me calling? (Calling for you?)
Can you hear me screaming? (Screaming for you?)
It is like I'm naked out in the rain
Alone and dealing with the pain
Can you hear me calling, calling, calling?

Remember the days we spent together, hey
Would give anything to have them forever
And all the things we used to laugh at
I wish I could bring it back, wish I could take it back, yeah

Now I know things that I never knew
I'm standing out here and I'm calling you
You mean the world to me and believe that it's true
I love you

Can you hear me calling? (Calling for you?)
Can you hear me screaming? (Screaming for you?)
It is like I'm naked out in the rain
Alone and dealing with the pain
Can you hear me calling, calling, calling, yeah?
Screaming, yeah

Calling, you mean the world to me
You mean the world to me
Screaming, you mean the world to me
You mean the world to me

Can you hear me calling? (Calling for you?)
Can you hear me screaming? (Screaming for you?)
It is like I'm naked out in the rain
Alone and dealing with the pain
Can you hear me calling, calling, calling?</pre></div>
