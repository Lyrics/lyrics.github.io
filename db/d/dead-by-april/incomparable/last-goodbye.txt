Like a closing door I'm slowly shutting down
Like a falling leaf just waiting for the ground
Don't even bother, nothing can stop it
Tried my best but I just can't top it

It will take a lifetime before I love again
You will see me die before I love again
Saying my last goodbye
Saying my last goodbye, goodbye, goodbye
Saying my last goodbye, goodbye, goodbye

All the broken pieces shattered all around me
They've been lying there since the day that you left me
I'm chanceless to fight against it
Tried my best but I can't break it

It will take a lifetime before I love again
You will see me die before I love again
Saying my last goodbye
Saying my last goodbye, goodbye, goodbye
Saying my last goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, yeah

Saying my last goodbye
Goodbye

It will take a lifetime

It will take a lifetime before I love again
You will see me die before I love again
Saying my last goodbye
Saying my last goodbye, goodbye, goodbye
Saying my last goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, yeah

Saying my last goodbye, yeah
Goodbye
