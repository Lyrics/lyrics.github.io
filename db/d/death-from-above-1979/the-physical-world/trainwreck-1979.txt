I was born on a highway in a trainwreck
With a heart that was beatin' outta my chest
So now I follow it around the world, I can't keep up
If I don't get it soon I know I'll bleed until I drop

'Cause I want it all
I can't get enough
'Cause I want it all
I can't get enough

There's a darkness and a hollow on the highway
Every cross on the road side tells a story
So now I follow it around the world, I can't keep up
The story never ends as long as we have blood and guts

'Cause I want it all
I can't get enough
'Cause I want it all
I can't get enough
Can't get enough
I can't get enough

It ran off the track, 11/79
While the immigrants slept, there wasn't much time
The mayor came callin' and got 'em outta bed
They packed up their families and headed up wind

A poison cloud, a flaming sky
200,000 people and no one died
And all before the pocket dial
Yeah

I keep searchin' and searchin'
I keep searchin' and searchin'

Now I'm stranded, tied on the tracks
There's no hero, there's no villain
There's nobody I can blame, the story's still the same
I'm never satisfied, it's a problem with my brain

I keep searchin' and searchin'
I keep searchin' and searchin'

'Cause I want it all
I can't get enough
'Cause I want it all
I can't get enough

(Can't get enough) I can't get enough
(Can't get enough) I can't get enough
(Can't get enough) I can't get enough
(Can't get enough) I can't get enough
