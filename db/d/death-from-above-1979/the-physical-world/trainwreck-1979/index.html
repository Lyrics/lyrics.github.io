<title>Death From Above 1979 â€“ Trainwreck 1979 | Lyrics</title>
<meta name="description" content="I was born on a highway in a trainwreck / With a heart that was beatin' outta my chest / So now I follow it around the world, I can't keep up / If I don't get it soon I know I'll bleed until I drop / 'Cause I want it all / I can't get enough / 'Cause I want it all / I can't get enough / There's a darkness and a hollow on the highway / Every cross on the road side tells a story / So now I follow it around the world, I can't keep up / The story never ends as long as we have blood and guts / 'Cause I want it all / I can't get enough / 'Cause I want it all / I can't get enough / Can't get enough / I can't get enough / It ran off the track, 11/79 / While the immigrants slept, there wasn't much time / The mayor came callin' and got 'em outta bed / They packed up their families and headed up wind / A poison cloud, a flaming sky / 200,000 people and no one died / And all before the pocket dial / Yeah / I keep searchin' and searchin' / I keep searchin' and searchin' / Now I'm stranded, tied on the tracks / There's no hero, there's no villain / There's nobody I can blame, the story's still the same / I'm never satisfied, it's a problem with my brain / I keep searchin' and searchin' / I keep searchin' and searchin' / 'Cause I want it all / I can't get enough / 'Cause I want it all / I can't get enough / (Can't get enough) I can't get enough / (Can't get enough) I can't get enough / (Can't get enough) I can't get enough / (Can't get enough) I can't get enough / _____________________ / Name Trainwreck 1979 / Artist Death From Above 1979 / Album The Physical World"/>
