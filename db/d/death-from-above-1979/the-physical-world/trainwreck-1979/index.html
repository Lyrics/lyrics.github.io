<title>Death From Above 1979 â€“ Trainwreck 1979 | Lyrics</title>
<meta name="description" content="I was born on a highway in a trainwreck / With a heart that was beatin' outta my chest / So now I follow it around the world, I can't keep up / If I don't get it soon I know I'll bleed until I drop / / 'Cause I want it"/>
