it's not me in the reflection
just a phantom in the glass

you still believe what you see
your obsession
reflection
concession
aggression
your reflection
and you believe what you see in the prism
who would you be?
a phantom in the glass
holding on to me

and you only believe what you can see
a prism holding energy
a phantom in the glass now
a prisoner of memory
seeing what you want to see
see what you fear to be

a prism holding energy
a phantom in the glass now
a prisoner of memory
seeing what you want to see
show me what you want to be

your obsession
with the reflection
is a concession
to our regression
