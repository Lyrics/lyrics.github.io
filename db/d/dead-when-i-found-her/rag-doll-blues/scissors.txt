selecting the pictures, scrapbook full
collected memory, the past preserved, history learned
I know what I want and I'm waiting
I know what I need I'm not playing
you're easier said than done
it's easy to make that choice alone
we'll never know whose won

I want to carve my name in her noise
find comfort in these childhood toys
I want to be dirty and clean at the same time

I never thought it'd be so easy to cut through me
no matter what you do it's too easy to cut through you
