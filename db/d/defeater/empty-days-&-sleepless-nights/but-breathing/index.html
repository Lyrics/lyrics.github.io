<title>Defeater â€“ But Breathing | Lyrics</title>
<meta name="description" content="Unwanted, but breathing. / In the next room, sleeping. / My mother, she's crying and my father's been drinking. / In our run down apartment, where the roof is still leaking. / He's cursing and cussing, it's just the whiskey talking. / I've got lots of memories like this one. / Of empty days and nights spent tired and lonesome. / When I think back to all of it, / Well it's all too much, / Well it's all too much when you're just a little kid. / My little brother, just a newborn baby. / In the image of my mother, she says he's a blessing. / But not to my father, oh how he hates him. / "An undeserving mistake." He calls him a burden. / I've got lots of memories like this one. / Of picking sides and picking fights between them. / When I think back to all of it, / Well it's all too much, / Well it's all too much when you're just a little kid. / When I wake up in the morning it all feels like a bad dream, / One that follows you and haunts you endlessly. / Yeah haunts me endlessly. / Broken and beaten from the abuse and the cheating, / The addiction, the lying and the promise of leaving. / While my old man was a bastard, I admired and loved him. / Us two kids, we were born in to a family, not a fortune. / ___________________ / Name But Breathing / Artist Defeater / Album Empty Days & Sleepless Nights"/>
