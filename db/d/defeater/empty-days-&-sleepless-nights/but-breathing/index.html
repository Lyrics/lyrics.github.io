He calls him a burden.</p><p>I've got lots of memories like this one.<br/>Of picking sides and picking fights between them.<br/>When I think back to all of it,<br/>Well it's all too much,<br/>Well it's all too much when you're just a little kid.</p><p>When I wake up in the morning it all feels like a bad dream,<br/>One that follows you and haunts you endlessly.<br/>Yeah haunts me endlessly.</p><p>Broken and beaten from the abuse and the cheating,<br/>The addiction, the lying and the promise of leaving.<br/>While my old man was a bastard, I admired and loved him.<br/>Us two kids, we were born in to a family, not a fortune.</p></article></div>
