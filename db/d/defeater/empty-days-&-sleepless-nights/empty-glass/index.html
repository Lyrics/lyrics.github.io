<title>Defeater â€“ Empty Glass | Lyrics</title>
<meta name="description" content="The way she looked at you, tears streaming down her face. / You felt the brush of her dress as she walked away. / And that's all it took, sat down to buy her a drink. / An empty or a half full glass, it all goes down the same. / And that's the way that it's been, years later she took your name. / Hopeful and now unafraid. Your gut sinks each time you see her. / Another night at the Copper Coin. / Another night, another night. / And that's all it took, sat down to buy her a drink. / An empty or a half full glass, it all goes down the same. / And that's the way that it's been, years later she took your name. / Hopeful and now unafraid. Your gut sinks each time you see her. / Tell me about the old days. / Another night at the Copper Coin. / Tell me about the old days. / Put the sun into the sea. / Because there ain't nothing like your smile, / Your legs and those eyes. / Tell me about the old days. / Because there ain't nothing like your smile, / Your legs and those eyes. / And I will beg / And steal and borrow / To keep you safe for your whole life. / _________________ / Name Empty Glass / Artist Defeater / Album Empty Days & Sleepless Nights"/>
