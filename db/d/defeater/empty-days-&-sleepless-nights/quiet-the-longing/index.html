<title>Defeater â€“ Quiet The Longing | Lyrics</title>
<meta name="description" content="You sit, and you stir / You grieve and you grieve / The same chair as your old man / Your mother's worse than you think / Sunken eyes and a withering frame / The needle quiets the longing / That poison, it fills...; it fills her veins / (One by one, one by one) / So quiet when the pain comes / Your mother's rosary ain't bringing father home / Blood rushes with cigarette burns / There ain't no God coming to save her / So quiet as the clouds roll / Your mother's rosary wrapped on the bed post / Blood rushes with cigarette burns / On that dock every night until your head hurts / You sit, and you stir / You grieve and you grieve / The longer you sit at the ocean / You lose more time than you think / Your blood runs cold / Wind biting under your coat / Pull it tight to your chest / Your mother is praying for death / Much more than you know / So quiet when the pain comes / Your mother's rosary ain't bringing father home / Blood rushes with cigarette burns / There ain't no God coming to save her / So quiet as the clouds roll / Your mother's rosary wrapped on the bed post / Blood rushes with cigarette burns / On that dock every night until your head hurts / "You coward (you coward) / This is your fault / Our family / Has lost everything" / Look down at your hands and your lit cigarette / Put it to your lips and breathe it in / Everything starts to fade and your body is numb / And when you wake in the morning you're in the house all alone / _______________________ / Name Quiet The Longing / Artist Defeater / Album Empty Days & Sleepless Nights"/>
