"Dear God, what have you done?"
Those words ring loud in the back of your head.
That bottle lies in a thick, blood red.

"I ain't no forgiver, forgetter."
Our mother waits in vain for a God that never loved us.
As much as she prayed, he never showed up.

"Dear God, where have you gone?"
Your brother is gone in the blink of an eye.
That January night, our father lays cold.
"Where are you going to go?
You're only seventeen years old."

"I ain't no forgiver, forgetter."
Our mother waits in vain for a God that never loved us.
As much as she prayed, he never showed up.

Those cold steel tracks beneath your feet,
Those same rail ties where you dodged those trains.
When we were just two kids, it still feels the same;
That warm blood rush when the train comes.
(When the train comes)

"I ain't no forgiver, forgetter."
"I will find you, and put that vice to your head.
Again, and again, and again, and again, and again."
