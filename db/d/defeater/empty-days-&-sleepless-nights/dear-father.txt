Bury him in the cold wet ground.
Familiar faces would have made him proud.
The military and the working man,
The history of the life he lived.

"Can you feel that soil covering your coffin?"
Can you feel?

So what are you going to do?
Be the hero that your father was?
So what are you going to do?
Be the man he made you to be?

And you are your father's son.
Dear father, dear father.
Be the hero that your father was.
Be the man he made you to be.

The war-torn stories that he told you
You've got a hell of a lot to live up to.
An airborne man with a scar and wound,
"Never make a promise that you can't prove."

Dear father, dear father.

So what are you going to do?
Be the hero that your father was?
So what are you going to do?
Be the man he made you to be?

And you are your father's son.
Dear father, dear father.
Be the hero that your father was.
Be the man he made you to be.

"Where are you? Where are you?
You coward. You coward."
