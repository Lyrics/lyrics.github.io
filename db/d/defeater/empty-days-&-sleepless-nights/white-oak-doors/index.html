    <div class="view"><article id="lyrics"><p>Lost in your own head, but then a knock at the door.<br/>Put down that drink, your steps creaking the floor.<br/>Go and get the gun, distract yourself from death.<br/>Back against the door, your hands are starting to sweat.<br/>Slowly cock the gun, slowly move to the side,<br/>Slowly turn the handle, slowly open it wide.<br/>You catch a glimpse of his face. Your heart sinks in your chest;<br/>Your hands start to shake because you know that it's him.<br/>Just the coward and you standing silent, dead air.<br/>So you pull him inside into your father's chair.<br/>"Your mother is dead, all thanks to you.<br/>Her addiction got worse after you left you damn fool.<br/>What you did to our father, I promised you'd pay up.<br/>I'm going to take your life, but it don't feel like enough."<br/>Cold steel to his head, walk him to his death.</p><p>Walk him down past the white oak doors.<br/>Walk him out past the boardwalk and your old shipyard.<br/>Your pistol in his side, make him pay.<br/>On the outskirts of town, pass the old quarry now.<br/>Walk him down to those cold steel tracks.<br/>You stumble drunk with the gun in his back.</p><p>"Now get down on your knees on the tracks where you shamed me.<br/>But this time, the dodge ain't going to end so pretty.<br/>Either a bullet or that train steaming just ahead<br/>Is going to end your days. You coward little kid."</p><p>You sit and you stir, while he waits for his death.<br/>You'll never forgive him, and you never did forget.<br/>He'll never see the sun again.<br/>Make him pay off his debt.<br/>Stand on those tracks, cold steel under your feet,<br/>Barrel to his temple. "Your rotting mother, you will soon re-meet,"<br/>You whisper in his ear, feel his whole body shake.<br/>In an instant he's got your arm, he's got your gun, you're held down by his weight.<br/>You feel the cold steel above and below.<br/>You feel your stomach tie in knots when the train whistle blows.<br/>You feel the warm of the blood where the barrel digs in.<br/>From your cheek to your mouth, you taste the sweat and the tin.<br/>You don't cry, you don't beg. You've been waiting for this.<br/>For the coward, or for death, just to see your wife again.<br/>That train is so close, so loud and so clear.<br/>Your hands stop shaking and it's all that you hear.<br/>Just like father. "You took him.<br/>If this is how it's going to be<br/>I would rather die at the hands of my own family."</p></article></div>
