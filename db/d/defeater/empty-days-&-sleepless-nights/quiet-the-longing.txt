You sit, and you stir
You grieve and you grieve
The same chair as your old man
Your mother's worse than you think
Sunken eyes and a withering frame
The needle quiets the longing
That poison, it fills...; it fills her veins
(One by one, one by one)

So quiet when the pain comes
Your mother's rosary ain't bringing father home
Blood rushes with cigarette burns
There ain't no God coming to save her
So quiet as the clouds roll
Your mother's rosary wrapped on the bed post
Blood rushes with cigarette burns
On that dock every night until your head hurts

You sit, and you stir
You grieve and you grieve
The longer you sit at the ocean
You lose more time than you think
Your blood runs cold
Wind biting under your coat
Pull it tight to your chest
Your mother is praying for death
Much more than you know

So quiet when the pain comes
Your mother's rosary ain't bringing father home
Blood rushes with cigarette burns
There ain't no God coming to save her
So quiet as the clouds roll
Your mother's rosary wrapped on the bed post
Blood rushes with cigarette burns
On that dock every night until your head hurts

"You coward (you coward)
This is your fault
Our family
Has lost everything"


Look down at your hands and your lit cigarette
Put it to your lips and breathe it in
Everything starts to fade and your body is numb
And when you wake in the morning you're in the house all alone
