<title>Defeater â€“ White Knuckles | Lyrics</title>
<meta name="description" content="You're going to find him, and make him pay. / Stumble out to the bar. / "Take one more look at her, / And it will be the end of your days. / You low-life bookie, you don't scare me. / I ain't settling no debt, / I ain't saving no face. / One more drink then I'm gone / And then I'll drag you out of this place." / Put it down for the courage, / Your fists clench with the blood rush. / White knuckles when the hit lands, / Cold concrete and blurred vision. / Stumble home from the bar. / Stuttered steps home to your front door. / On the tip of your tongue, your remorse. / Shamed by the loss and defeat. / Shamed by your let down to her. / The same walk as that first night. / Now alone you know that this ain't right. / Better days and the promise you made, / Ain't no man supposed to walk out that way. / Her ring lies in the thick red, / Your tears swell, and the room spins. / "Dear God, what have I done?" / You left her, and he took her, he laid with her. / You bastard's son. / With the blackout / And the bloodstains, / Your teeth clench, / Then the pain comes. / ____________________ / Name White Knuckles / Artist Defeater / Album Empty Days & Sleepless Nights"/>
