"Where were you every night that I woke up alone?"
Cold sweat keeps you up.
"This ain't no kind of home."

"Come pick me up."

"Damn those boys at the bar,
Damn the way that you drink."
Cold sweat, sleepless nights,
When your hands start to shake.
"Damn that pier where you sit,
Damn your vengeance for him
There's no bringing him back,
Your father is buried and dead."

But you can't let go of that hero's death.
And you've been left with,
Left with his debt.

You couldn't fight for your country
And your mother is an addict.

"How dare you?"
"This ain't no kind of home."

"Come pick me up."

"Damn that man that you humor,
He only wants one thing from you.
Damn those looks that you give him.
Parlor tricks and I'm played for a fool."

"How dare you?"
"This ain't no kind of home."
