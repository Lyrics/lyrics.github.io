(You've got to find her.)<br/>Your mother ain't fit to be alone.<br/>Her rosary beads are gone, there's only one place she'd be.<br/>The sun is nearly up, put your jacket back on and walk down the street.</p><p>Feel the wind start to shift, cold and biting.<br/>Just like everything that's changed.<br/>When you do find her, (when you do find her)<br/>Take the only family that you've got back to home.</p><p>Head down, walk through the crowds and the families downtown.<br/>You jealous bitter old man, it's just yourself you can't stand.<br/>The man that took away your wife, coward that left you behind,<br/>You would kill them both if you could. (Kill them both if you could)<br/>Head down, cigarette in hand.<br/>Concrete, cold brick and sando the place where she prays,<br/>Where she suffers her days.<br/>Sleepless nights with the dirt when the addiction hurts.<br/>Up to that old white oak door church.</p><p>And that's where you find her in that last pew.</p><p>You touch her cold hand, your mother is gone.<br/>In front of her God, needle in her arm.<br/>The family plot will be filled.<br/>The perfect ending to a tragedy.<br/>Put her in the cold wet ground.<br/>Finally at peace with her husband now.</p><p>Lost all will, empty house.<br/>Hours strain, but months pass alone with your gun.<br/>Blue-collar shipyard, your days have gone.</p><p>Lost it all for the promise of a normal life.<br/>All taken from you when you lost your wife.<br/>So you sit in that chair, waiting for death, barrel to your head.</p></article></div>
