    <div class="view"><article id="lyrics"><p>March. 1945 unwanted from his first breath.<br/>A mother's blessing born, a father's burden worn.<br/>The bright shine of the sunrise along the tile floor to the open door.<br/>With blood on the streets she lay on the mattress.<br/>Staring aimlessly.<br/>Numb, dark and decayed<br/>On the bathroom floor of their rundown apartment.<br/>Scraping fingers on tile just to feel something.<br/>Unwanted by a bastard father.<br/>Unwanted, but through the hazel eyes of his mother.<br/>She's praying for god to save her.<br/>"Please save me." but when she needs him most, he doesn't answer.<br/>Another rosary, another unanswered plea.<br/>"Please take us away, please let us be safe.<br/>Let everyone that sees me forget my face."<br/>But all she gets is the drunk with his fists and that old devil look in his eye.<br/>Him and Jack, that gambling debt, that old devil look in his eye.<br/>And without warning he raises his hand to her and says,<br/>"Your god can't hear you, not down here.<br/>No one will save you because no one cares."<br/>And with her newborn boy, they would cry until the early morning light.<br/>It was the first of many, many sleepless nights.</p></article></div>
