<title>Defeater â€“ Nameless Streets | Lyrics</title>
<meta name="description" content="As a kid the summers seemed so long. / The dusk; a never ending song. / Too much, too young. / He'd never hear it again. / A walk through the dismal streets, the alleys where the junkies sleep. / Too much, too young. / "That will never be me." / Slow, hand in hand to the boardwalk's end. / His mother's words like the biting wind. / "Please don't leave me." / He'll never hear them again. / "Keep quiet, stay out of sight." / Her sunken eyes that used to burn so bright. / "Please don't leave me." / So he hid pressed against the wall, under stairs in the darkened hall. / The sound of heartbreak reminded him of home. / Shadows move slow across the floor, a minute seemed like a day or more. / The end of heartache when she opened the door. / The sights, sounds, smell of burnt out shame, pride, spite and love. / They all come here to die. / He sobs, "Please take me a away. Please mother bring us home safe on nameless streets the way we came." / Suddenly, she prayed for better days and for redemption. / Sullenly she prayed to keep from harm's way and for conviction. / But there's no forgiveness here. / No hope beyond that pier. / No way to get out now, not for her in this dead end town. / And that drunk is waiting up, him and jack and the empty cup. / "Where you been? What you on? Who'd you fuck?" / One more drink to toast good luck. / She gets a stiff hand from the old like the bourbon he's been drinking. / Black out. / ______________________ / Name Nameless Streets / Artist Defeater / Album Travels"/>
