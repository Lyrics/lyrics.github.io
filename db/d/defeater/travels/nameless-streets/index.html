    <div class="view"><article id="lyrics"><p>As a kid the summers seemed so long.<br/>The dusk; a never ending song.<br/>Too much, too young.<br/>He'd never hear it again.<br/>A walk through the dismal streets, the alleys where the junkies sleep.<br/>Too much, too young.<br/>"That will never be me."<br/>Slow, hand in hand to the boardwalk's end.<br/>His mother's words like the biting wind.<br/>"Please don't leave me."<br/>He'll never hear them again.<br/>"Keep quiet, stay out of sight."<br/>Her sunken eyes that used to burn so bright.<br/>"Please don't leave me."<br/>So he hid pressed against the wall, under stairs in the darkened hall.<br/>The sound of heartbreak reminded him of home.<br/>Shadows move slow across the floor, a minute seemed like a day or more.<br/>The end of heartache when she opened the door.<br/>The sights, sounds, smell of burnt out shame, pride, spite and love.<br/>They all come here to die.<br/>He sobs, "Please take me a away. Please mother bring us home safe on nameless streets the way we came."<br/>Suddenly, she prayed for better days and for redemption.<br/>Sullenly she prayed to keep from harm's way and for conviction.<br/>But there's no forgiveness here.<br/>No hope beyond that pier.<br/>No way to get out now, not for her in this dead end town.<br/>And that drunk is waiting up, him and jack and the empty cup.<br/>"Where you been? What you on? Who'd you fuck?"<br/>One more drink to toast good luck.<br/>She gets a stiff hand from the old like the bourbon he's been drinking.<br/>Black out.</p></article></div>
