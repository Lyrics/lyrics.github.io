Swing low, swing low. Pray my soul to keep."<br/>Rest now, the sun's down. Rest long, rest well.<br/>Swing low, swing low."<br/>Redemption lies in an old farm house.<br/>"Room and board for the strong hands we need. All i can offer is roof over head. Another day, another dollar."</p></article></div>
