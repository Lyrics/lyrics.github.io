    <div class="view"><article id="lyrics"><p>Roll on through to the other side of town.<br/>Passed the quarry, the river beds, over bridges and bunker sheds.<br/>Roll on through to the pits and the rail car yard.<br/>"This is where you prove your worth."<br/>A brother's dare, that devil's smirk.<br/>"Oh, this is the way it will always be."<br/>A kid brother in the shadows of a cold heart's legacy.<br/>"Oh, this is where we see who runs first. It's you and me and the train. The steel tracks and the dirt. Oh, you can never live up to me."<br/>And so he stood trembling, waiting for smoke above the trees.<br/>Roll on through. He could feel it rumbling, he could feel it beneath his feet. Roll on through.<br/>"Closer now, hold your ground. steadfast, ignore the sound."<br/>Everything went quiet just before the rush took over his head.<br/>The pull and the push of the engine, think back with the coal and the steam.<br/>The racing thoughts, the questions, the adolescent rivalry.<br/>And with a nod from the elder, the younger's fear topples over.<br/>Over rails and over timber. "That's no dodge, you fucking coward."<br/>And the train rolls on. "Yellow-belly go home." and the train rolls on.</p></article></div>
