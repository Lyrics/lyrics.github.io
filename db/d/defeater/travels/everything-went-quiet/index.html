He could feel it rumbling, he could feel it beneath his feet. Roll on through.<span><br/></span>"Closer now, hold your ground. steadfast, ignore the sound."<span><br/></span>Everything went quiet just before the rush took over his head.<span><br/></span>The pull and the push of the engine, think back with the coal and the steam.<span><br/></span>The racing thoughts, the questions, the adolescent rivalry.<span><br/></span>And with a nod from the elder, the younger's fear topples over.<span><br/></span>Over rails and over timber.
