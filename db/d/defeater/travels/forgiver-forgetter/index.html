I never wanted to kill a man, like i want to kill you, man."<br/>The years of pain boiled over, trading blows across the counter.<br/>And when that devil was down he grabbed for his empty old friend Jack.<br/>He caught his eye as he took his last breath and that vice went to his head again and again.<br/>"Dear God, what have you done?" cried out his mother.<br/>"That devil drunk was no father. Another name on a list for unpaid bookies and gambling debts."<br/>That spiteful stare of his brother.<br/>"I ain't no forgiver or forgetter. I'll make you pay for this when you least expect it."<br/>He washed the blood from his hands, kissed his mother and stepped into cold night air.</p></article></div>
