Dear hope I lost you,
Found solace in a bottle
Now I'm my mother's only son

Brother of mine
I woke up with the sunrise
With an ache in my chest

Brother of mine
Now you sleep at the bottom
Of the blue pacific

Brother of mine
I woke up with the bottle
And an ache in my chest

Brother of mine
Now you sleep in the iron
Bottom, blue pacific

I find no comfort
I find no solace
I've got no use for these

I find no closure
I find no peace
Just these scarred up memories

I've got your letters
I've got your good luck
In your rabbit foot I keep

Around my throat
To keep me from dying
You've always been protecting me

Dear hope I lost you,
Found solace in a bottle
Now I'm my mother's only son

Brother of mine
I woke up with the sunrise
With an ache in my chest

Brother of mine
Now you sleep at the bottom
Of the blue pacific

Brother of mine
I woke up with the bottle
And an ache in my chest

Brother of mine
Now you sleep in the iron
Bottom, blue pacific
