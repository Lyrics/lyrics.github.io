I hope this finds you well
A father lost and mother dear
The family that's kept me here
A hard lesson learned, and I've learned it well
How to lose everything
How to push you away
How to lie when I say
I'll never raise a hand to the ones I love ever again
You begged and you prayed
For your god and his grace
To keep you safe
To save you from me

My broken spirit and back
My calloused shaking hands
The ache I carry in them
Are my grief and skeletons
The weight you carried inside
A weight that ain't my bloodline
Blackout the sunrise
I count these burdens as mine
And still all you see is that bastard in me

Believing in hell
A father lost and mother dear
The family that I squandered here
A hard lesson learned, and I forgot it all
How to lose everything
How to push you away
How to lie when I say
I'll never raise a hand to the ones I love ever again
You begged and you prayed
For your god and his grace
To keep you safe
To save you from me

My broken spirit and back
My calloused shaking hands
The ache I carry in them
Are my grief and skeletons
The weight you carried inside
A weight that ain't my bloodline
Blackout the sunrise
I count these burdens as mine
And still all I see is that bastard in me
