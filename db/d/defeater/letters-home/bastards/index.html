<title>Defeater â€“ Bastards | Lyrics</title>
<meta name="description" content="I hope this finds you well / A father lost and mother dear / The family that's kept me here / A hard lesson learned, and I've learned it well / How to lose everything / How to push you away / How to lie when I say / I'll never raise a hand to the ones I love ever again / You begged and you prayed / For your god and his grace / To keep you safe / To save you from me / My broken spirit and back / My calloused shaking hands / The ache I carry in them / Are my grief and skeletons / The weight you carried inside / A weight that ain't my bloodline / Blackout the sunrise / I count these burdens as mine / And still all you see is that bastard in me / Believing in hell / A father lost and mother dear / The family that I squandered here / A hard lesson learned, and I forgot it all / How to lose everything / How to push you away / How to lie when I say / I'll never raise a hand to the ones I love ever again / You begged and you prayed / For your god and his grace / To keep you safe / To save you from me / My broken spirit and back / My calloused shaking hands / The ache I carry in them / Are my grief and skeletons / The weight you carried inside / A weight that ain't my bloodline / Blackout the sunrise / I count these burdens as mine / And still all I see is that bastard in me / ______________ / Name Bastards / Artist Defeater / Album Letters Home"/>
