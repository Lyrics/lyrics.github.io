I feel the distance in your letters sent
I left my family for the trenches
You've got me worried about leaving
You've got your needle, I've got my demons
You've got me homesick, I feel me slipping
I feel the cold hand of death is creeping
He took my brother to the ocean floor
I beg but death don't come, that fucking coward
I'd give me life for his, what could I have done differently?
Bled out and failed him, he never would have done that to me

Let me keep sinking
Let me keep drowning
I am no one
I am nothing

I feel the distance in your letters sent
(I feel the distance)
I left my family for the trenches
(I am desperate)
You've got me worried about leaving
(Got me homesick)
You've got your needle, I've got my demons
(I am hopeless)

And all I see is the bastard in me
