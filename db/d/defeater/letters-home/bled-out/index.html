<title>Defeater â€“ Bled Out | Lyrics</title>
<meta name="description" content="I feel the distance in your letters sent / I left my family for the trenches / You've got me worried about leaving / You've got your needle, I've got my demons / You've got me homesick, I feel me slipping / I feel the cold hand of death is creeping / He took my brother to the ocean floor / I beg but death don't come, that fucking coward / I'd give me life for his, what could I have done differently? / Bled out and failed him, he never would have done that to me / Let me keep sinking / Let me keep drowning / I am no one / I am nothing / I feel the distance in your letters sent / (I feel the distance) / I left my family for the trenches / (I am desperate) / You've got me worried about leaving / (Got me homesick) / You've got your needle, I've got my demons / (I am hopeless) / And all I see is the bastard in me / ______________ / Name Bled Out / Artist Defeater / Album Letters Home"/>
