    <div class="view"><div id="lyrics">Can you feel it building?
Can you feel it building?
Can you feel it building?
Can you feel it building?

Can you feel it building?
Devastation is on the way.
Feel the hair on the back of your neck
As the rush begins.

You can't take it away,
I earned this with sweat and blood.
You can't take it away,
Take what's mine.

Breathing new life back into me,
Challenging all the powers that be.

Can you feel, can you feel, can you feel,
Can you feel, can you feel, can you feel,
Can you feel, can you feel, can you feel?

Can you feel it slipping
As you lose your grip on me?
Can you face that I won in the end?
I can't keep from laughing.

You can't take it away,
I earned this with sweat and blood.
You can't take it away,
Take what's mine.

Breathing new life back into me,
Challenging all the powers that be.

Breathing new life back into me,
Challenging all the powers that be.

Breathing new life.
Breathing new life.
Breathing new life.

Don't you see it coming?
When you've caught on, it's too late.
When it hits, don't forget who I am,
Don't forget this face.

You can't take it away,
I earned this with sweat and blood.
You can't take it away,
Take what's mine.

Breathing new life back into me,
Challenging all the powers that be.

Breathing new life back into me,
Challenging all the powers that be.

Breathing new life.
Breathing new life.
Breathing new life.
Breathing new life.

Breathing new life.
