<title>Damageplan â€“ Save Me | Lyrics</title>
<meta name="description" content=""Save me from myself", I call out, / But no one hears my plea. / Burn my candle fast from both ends. / Nightmares grow from dreams. / You don't know, you can't see thrugh my eyes, / So you don't know me! / You don't know what's going through my mind, / But can you help me? / Save me from myself if you ever really cared. / Save me from myself, tell me you're not scared. / Intensity that grows within me, / Reflections of my pain. / I'll create or I'll destroy, / But either way it's always in my veins. / You don't know, you can't see through my eyes, / So you don't know me! / You don't know what's going through my mind, / But can you help me? / Save me from myself if you ever really cared. / Save me from myself, tell me you're not scared. / Save me from myself if you ever really cared. / Save me from myself, tell me you're not scared. / Save me from myself if you ever really cared. / Save me from myself, tell me you're not scared. / Save me from me / Save me from me / Save me from me / Save me from me / Save me from me / Save me / Save me / Save me from me / Save me / _____________ / Name Save Me / Artist Damageplan / Album New Found Power / Original text by Darrell Lance Abbott, Patrick A.
