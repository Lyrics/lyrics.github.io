Aaah, aaah, aaah, aaah
Aaah, aaah, aaah, aaah

Now that I'm all alone
Painfully aware
I'm starting to feel the cold
Knowing you're not there

Caught somewhere between my fears and dreams
And all I have are demons here for company

Come and look inside, hope you like what you see
And if you run and hide, you're scared of what is me
Bind my idle hands, they only claw at me
Drown in emptiness, my soul is left to bleed

Throwing a shadow on
Every thought I have
Knowing that something's gone
Echoes in my head

Aaah, aaah, aaah, aaah
Aaah, aaah, aaah, aaah

Caught somewhere between my fears and dreams
And all I have are demons here for company

Come and look inside, hope you like what you see
(denying what you see)
And if you run and hide, you're scared of what is me
(scared of what is me)
Bind my idle hands, they only claw at me
(they claw, yeah)
Drown in emptiness, my soul is left to bleed
(the soul is left to bleed)

Come and look inside, hope you like what you see
(denying what you see)
And if you run and hide, you're scared of what is me
(scared of what is me)
Bind my idle hands, they only claw at me
(they claw, yeah)
Drown in emptiness, my soul is left to bleed
(the soul is left to bleed)

Soul is left to bleed
(no, my soul is left to bleed)

Soul is left to bleed

Bleed
Bleed
(left to bleed)
Bleed
