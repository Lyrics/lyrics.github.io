<title>Damageplan â€“ Moment Of Truth | Lyrics</title>
<meta name="description" content="There were times when I questioned my reasons. / Thought I wouldn't last. / Seemed the hand of God held my head underwater. / Somehow I fought back. / It's still not over yet. / No, it won't let me quit. / Found myself more than just once / Praying down on my knees. / My search for answers only led to more questions. / Sometimes for faith you've got to bleed. / By now I've bled my share, / Now it's my turn to redeem. / When it comes my way I won't be scared, / I've been waiting all my life. / Pain has prepared me for the moment of truth, / And the true test this time. / Give all you have because you believe, / Sell your mortal soul. / And if you're not a predator, then, oh - you better pray. / Bet it all now or fold. / But there's still a danger there. / Don't become one of them. / When it comes my way I won't be scared, / I've been waiting all my life. / Pain has prepared me for the moment of truth, / And the true test this time. / For all I've done - some good some bad, / Don't hang me just yet! / Judge me not on one thing I've done, / See my whole life instead! / When it comes my way, I won't be scared, / I've been waiting all my life. / Pain has prepared me for the moment of truth, / And the true test this time. / _____________________ / Name Moment Of Truth / Artist Damageplan / Album New Found Power / Original text by Darrell Lance Abbott, Patrick A. Lachman, / Vincent Paul Abbott / Copyright Warner/Chappell Music, Inc"/>
