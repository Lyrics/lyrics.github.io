    <div class="view"><pre>Why have we waited so long,
Suppressing the power inside?
Tear away all that was wrong,
Something too massive to hide.

It's time to rip the chain from your neck,
Let go the past as you purge.
Free now from everything weighing you down,
Open the floodgates and surge with
New found power!
New found power!
New found power!
New found power!

Cleansing yourself of the past,
Learn from mistakes and move on.
Conquering new ground at last,
Unite and become twice as strong.

It's time to rip the chain from your neck,
Let go the past as you purge.
Free now from everything weighing you down,
Open the floodgates and surge with
New found power!
New found power!
New found power!
New found power!

Nothing ventured, nothing gained.
Hope was all that kept me sane.
Rise above and prove myself.
I'll survive without your help.
Shut you out, my strength comes from within.

New found power!
New found power!
New found power!
New found power!

New found power!
New found power!
New found power!
New found power!

Power!
Power!
