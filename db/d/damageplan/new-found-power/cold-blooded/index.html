    <div class="view"><div id="lyrics">Cold blooded,
Ice in my veins.

Cold blooded,
Ice in my veins.
Ice in my veins.

Spit in your face, another worthless liar.
I know your kind.
Save me the smile, you're just a cut-throat bastard.
I read your mind.

Nothing without the victim that you feed on.
Everyone knows you're just a parasite.
What can you do after you've killed it slowly?
Where can you go after you bled it dry?

For now I'll let you believe,
I let you get to me.
Aren't you in for a shock,
You stupid motherfucker?

You'll get what you deserve,
A victim of your own game.
You're already dead to me,
Your turn to get played.

Now I'm cold blooded,
I've got ice in my veins.
Now I'm cold blooded,
Just disengaged.

Having control - the only validation
You constantly need.
Power to you becomes intoxication
On which you feed.

Spewing your lies and your manipulation,
Playing with lives to you is just a game.
Being around you makes me fear that you might
Get on my skin and then contaminate.

For now I'll let you believe,
I let you get to me.

(You don't even see it coming, do you?)

You'll get what you deserve,
A victim of your own game.
You're already dead to me,
Your turn to get played.

Now I'm cold blooded,
I've got ice in my veins.
Now I'm cold blooded,
Just disengaged.

Your face just serves to remind
Everything that I don't want to be.
Guess my mind was made up long ago,
You won't get one thing more from me!

Now I'm cold blooded,
I've got ice in my veins.
Now I'm cold blooded,
Just disengaged.

Cold blooded.
Ice in my veins.

Nothing without the victim that you feed on.
Everyone knows you're just a parasite.

Cold blooded.
Ice in my veins.

Nothing without the victim that you feed on.
Everyone knows you're just a parasite.

Cold blooded.
Ice in my veins.

Nothing without the victim that you feed on.
Everyone knows you're just a parasite.

Cold blooded.
Ice in my veins.

Nothing without the victim that you feed on.
Everyone knows you're just a parasite.

Cold blooded.
Ice in my veins.
