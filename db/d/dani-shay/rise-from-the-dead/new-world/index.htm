<div><pre>This is the breakedown.
ha!
try to follow.


inside I'm crying, dying to ask why
We're working for nothng from 9 to 5
I can feel the exhaustion wearing on me
can't face the fact that -
I am not free

freedom is a lie we learned to believe
like a book with no pages we pretend to read
you envy me - let me tell you where I came from
I ran like hell through my imaganation
just to get away from what i did not understand
like how a boy becomes a coward and calls himself a men
and everyone around him pats him on the back
happily obvious ignoring all the facts
knick knack paddi whack give a dog a bone
sit, stay, roll over, run away from home
this is what we teach to the demons we create
avoid your inner conscience,
and hide from your mistakes
then lie awake hunted by your messed up thoughts
contemplating actions afraid of getting caught

this is how we're waiting on the edge
for the problems that haven't happened yet
paranoia is crawling into our head because
this is how we're waiting on the edge

I wonder why we're still falling for the same old tricks
it seems like we're  all broken and need to be fixed
were like robots aboarding the economy that failing anyway
and won't let us be who we wanna be
its sickening a world on the go
I need a triple tall hot latte and a blueberry scone
and for lunch, I'll take number 5
with a large diet coke
and an extra side of fries
and you can feed me lies
I'll eat them up to
at night I pray to god and ask him what to do

this is how wer'e wating on the edge
for the problems that haven't happened yet
paranoia is crawling into our head because
this is how we're waiting on te edge

and millions of children, dying of hunger
we cant see the lightning, cant hear the thunder
we are going under
if things don't change soon
the world will be dead by tomorrow at noon
raped of her glory
raped of her life
raped like the husbands rape their wives
and the wives have also lost their minds
drowning their kids
and feeding them lies..

all in favor of a new world say I
all in favor say I
all in favor of a new world say I
all in favor say I, aye

I don't wanna sit and wait for shit to hit the fan
but you can, if you want
with the family you brought
to the land of all promises
where all you ever wanted was a chance to take a stand
against the world that took your confidence
because you have been on it since
the day you turned ten
and your dad said you have to earn your money to spend
thats what you did - you became part of the system
working to earn a respect of old rich men.
shining their shoes, and pressing their pants
playing their games and dancing their dance
basically home to get a chance -
a chance to get notice, to maybe advance
but, let me let you in on a little secret -
you can package your pride, and tell theme to keep it
because you dont need them. they need you caus' you feed them
you do the work while they sit tall cause you are lucky you have a job at all
right?

this is how we're waiting on the edge
for the problems that haven't happened yet
paranoia is crawling into our head because
this is how we're waiting on the edge

so one more time everybody, alright.

this is how we're waiting on the edge
for the problems that haven't happened yet
paranoia is crawling into our head because
this is how we're waiting on the edge

here we go


all in favor of a new world say I
all in favor say I
all in favor of a new world say I
all in favor say I, aye
(mani "I" and "say I" in backgrond.)</pre></div>
