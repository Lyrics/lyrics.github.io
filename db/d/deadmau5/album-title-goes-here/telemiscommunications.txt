Hey babe, how's your day been?
No, you first. Uh, what?
The delay's quite bad
Yeah, sorry
Where are you? I can't really hear you
A taxi distracted
Anyway you... you were saying?
Wait, uh..
Now they're waving me over
Can I call you back?
Yeah, everything's fine
Why? Am I? I don't know why
I probably just need sleep
It's been a busy week
Sorry, I've got to go
Sorry, Ok... bye

This is just so unlike us
Cut back to horizontalisms
If we could win just one small touch
Contact versus tele-miscommunications

Plan foiled
The sirens pass by
Kids screaming
The longest public announcement
Reach check-in, finally got through
Running for a flight, shoes off
You're calling voicemail
In-joke, group laughter
Closing scenes in a meeting
Angel (angel) why didn't you tell me?
One second, someone needs directions
Can't you see I'm on the phone?

Did I tell you I loved you today?
