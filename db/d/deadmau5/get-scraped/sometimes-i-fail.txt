So we've been talking about 'cool' and its uh ramifications, and how it applies to the hip scene. But maybe you could give us some examples now, of the opposite of cool - 'uncool', just exactly what is 'uncool'?
Yeah, why-n't-we have some thoughts on that...

It-it-it's uncool to nod on the street corner waiting for the light to change.
And uh it uh... It-it's uncool to let anybody know your uncle is a registered pharmacist, uncool for the whole family.
You know, it's uncool to buddy with a known fink.
And it's uncool to ask "Where'd you get it?"
It's disastrously uncool to let friends use your penthouse as a forwarding address for packages from Mexico.
You know and it's uncool to ask "Where'd you get it?"
And it is uncool to wear shades after sunset.
