<title>Deadmau5 â€“ One Trick Pony | Lyrics</title>
<meta name="description" content="Pump the brakes, you're a red-flag, red light / Holdin' up for stop signs. I'll never be sloppy seconds / Go ahead, take them back, your one, two, three minutes / All you do is take, take, takin' off the little / Got More goin' on I'd rather be eating glass, / Stick hot needles in my eyes, / Go ahead and tap that ass / Draw them up, yeah like there's candy / Girl I ain't tryin'a connect or paint a picture / I'm not in it, never will be / You can't be me, get your freak on, / You can suck it, they've all seen it / And you liked it, now who wants it? / Cotton candy sugar high / Break your bones when you come down / You're a one trick, my trick pony who's next to hop on / Ride, ride, ride... / Bout to bring a blood spill / We've both been there, what's the next stop? I won't sit still / Back to bring up what's real / We've both been there, what's the next stop? I won't sit still / ____________________ / Name One Trick Pony / Artist Deadmau5 / Album 4x4=12"/>
