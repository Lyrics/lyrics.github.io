<div><pre>Let's play musical chairs
One of my favorite games
Especially now
That you and I
Have traded place
You walk around
In shoes that don't fit
For a change
There is no way for you
To win this race
Kris Kross and turn your shirt
Inside out
You like to think
I can figure you out but
The tables have turned
What goes around
Comes around
You're about to get burned
Flip the script
You're checkin' in
I'm checkin' you out

You're just too sweet
Until you get on my nerves
And hurt like cavity
You left a bad taste in my mouth
My Sour Patch Kid
You and me
It's not mystery
No magic trick
Let me hear this broken record again
Just press repeat

I can be your new favorite waste of time
And you'll be mine
All I want is your attention
It's all the same thing
Are you in?
What's it gonna be?
Don't roll with the punches
Make it hard for me
Baby


Drop you like a needle on the record
Scratch my itch
Watch you walk in circles
Hit the beat

Drop you like a needle on the record
Flick my switch
Go around in circles
Hit the beat

Drop you like a needle on the record
Scratch my itch
Watch you walk in circles
Hit the beat

Drop you like a needle on the record
Flick my switch
Go around in circles
Hit the beat

Drop you like a needle on the record
Scratch my itch
Watch you walk in circles
Hit the beat

Drop you like a needle on the record
Flick my switch
Go around in circles
Hit the beat
