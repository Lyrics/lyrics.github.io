    <div class="view"><div id="lyrics">So am I still waiting
For this world to stop hating
Can't find a good reason
Can't find hope to believe in

Drop dead, a bullet to my head
Your words are like a gun in hand
You can't change the state of the nation
We just need some motivation
These eyes have seen no conviction
Just lies and more contradiction
So tell me, what would you say
I'd say its time too late

So am I still waiting
For this world to stop hating
Can't find a good reason
Can't find hope to believe in

Ignorance and understanding
We're the first ones to jump in line
Out of step for what we believe in
But who's left to stop the bleeding
How far will we take this
It's not hard to see through the fakeness
So tell me, what would you say
I'd say its time too late

So am I still waiting
For this world to stop hating
Can't find a good reason
Can't find hope to believe

This can't last forever
Time won't make things better
I feel so alone
Can't help myself
And no one knows
If this is worthless
Tell me
So

What have we done
We're in a war that can't be won
This can't be real
'Cause I don't know what to feel

So am I still waiting
For this world to stop hating
Can't find a good reason
Can't find hope to believe

So am I still waiting
For this world to stop hating
Can't find a good reason
For this world to believe</div></div>
