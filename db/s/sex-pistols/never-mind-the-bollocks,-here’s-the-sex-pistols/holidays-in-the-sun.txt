A cheap holiday in other peoples misery!

I don't wanna holiday in the sun
I wanna go to the new Belsen
I wanna see some history
'Cause now I got a reasonable economy

Now I got a reason, now I got a reason
Now I got a reason and I'm still waiting
Now I got a reason, now I got reason to be waiting
The Berlin Wall

Sensurround sound in a two-inch wall
I was waiting for the communist call
I didn't ask for sunshine, and I got World War Three
I'm looking over the wall and they're looking at me

Now I got a reason, now I got a reason
Now I got a reason and I'm still waiting
Now I got a reason, now I got a reason to be waiting
The Berlin Wall

They're staring all night and they're staring all day
I had no reason to be here at all
And now I got a reason, it's no real reason
And I'm waiting at Berlin Wall
I'm gonna go over the Berlin Wall, I don't understand this thing at all
I gonna go over and over the Berlin Wall, I'm gonna go over the Berlin Wall
I'm gonna go over the Berlin Wall

Claustrophobia, there's too much paranoia
There's too many closets we went there before
And now I gotta reason, it's no real reason to be waiting
The Berlin Wall
I gotta go over the Wall, I don't understand this thing at all
This third rate B-movie show, cheap dialogue, cheap essential scenery
I gotta go over the wall, I wanna go over the Berlin Wall
Before me come over the Berlin Wall, I don't understand this bit at all
I'm gonna go over the wall, I'm gonna go over the Berlin Wall
I'm gonna go over the Berlin Wall, come on come over the Berlin Wall
I don't understand this thing at all
Please don't be waiting for me
