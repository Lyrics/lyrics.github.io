Right!
Now

I am an Antichrist
I am an anarchist
Don't know what I want but I know how to get it
I wanna destroy passers-by

'Cause I
Wanna be anarchy
No dogs body

Anarchy for the U.K.
It's coming sometime and maybe
I give a wrong time, stop a traffic line
Your future dream is a shopping scheme

'Cause I
Wanna be anarchy
In the city

How many ways to get what you want
I use the best, I use the rest
I use the NME, I use anarchy

'Cause I
Wanna be anarchy
It's the only way to be

Is this the MPLA?
Or is this the UDA?
Or is this the IRA?
I thought it was the UK

Or just
Another country
Another council tenancy

I wanna be anarchy
And I wanna be anarchy
Know what I mean?
I wanna be an anarchist
Get pissed
Destroy!
