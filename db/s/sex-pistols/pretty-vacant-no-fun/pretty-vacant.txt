There's no point in asking, you'll get no reply
I just steam in but I don't decide
I got no reason, it's all too much
You'll always find us out to lunch

Oh, we're so pretty, oh so pretty vacant
Oh, we're so pretty, oh so pretty vacant

Don't ask us what were doing 'cause we're not all there
I don't pretend, 'cause I don't care
I don't believe illusions, 'cause too much ain't for real
Stop your cheap comments, 'cause we know what we feel

We're pretty, pretty vacant
We're pretty, pretty vacant
Now and we don't care

There's no point in asking, you'll get no reply
I just steam in but I don't decide
I got no reason, it's all too much
You'll always find me out to lunch

Oh, we're so pretty, oh so pretty vacant
Oh, we're so pretty, oh so pretty vacant
Now and we don't care

We're pretty
A pretty vacant
We're pretty
A pretty vacant
We're pretty
A pretty vacant
We're pretty
A pretty vacant

And we don't care
