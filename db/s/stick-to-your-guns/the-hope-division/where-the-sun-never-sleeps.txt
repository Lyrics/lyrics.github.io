I live in the valley by the sea
Lined with the scent of orange trees.
This is the place that's always loved me.
I wake where the sun never sleeps,
In-between the mountains and where the water and sky meet.

This is the place I was raised,
My family and my friends.
This is my everything.
This is the place I was saved,
My beginning and end,
I wouldn't trade it for anything.

And Just because I leave you doesn't mean you leave my mind.
I think about you all the time.
This is my solid ground, this sun isn't going down, down, never going down.
And I have seen a lot of amazing things,
But there's no feeling like coming home brings.
Now nothing can bring me down, down, down, never bring me down.

Just look at the view,
If this is wrong then I don't wanna be true.
If you're not here then I don't wanna be you.
Even if I tried I couldn't forget,
It only makes sense that my heart belongs where the sun sets.
And when I start to smell the salt from the sea,
I know I'm close,
I'm coming home.

And Just because I leave you doesn't mean you leave my mind.
I think about you all the time.
This is my solid ground, this sun isn't going down, down, never going down.
And I have seen a lot of amazing things,
But there's no feeling like coming home brings.
Now nothing can bring me down, down, down, never bring me down.

Orange County, this one's for you!

And Just because I leave you doesn't mean you leave my mind.
I think about you all the time.
This is my solid ground, this sun isn't going down, down, never going down.
And I have seen a lot of amazing things,
But there's no feeling like coming home brings.
Now nothing can bring me down, down, down, never bring me down.

I think about you all the time.
Down, down, never bring me down.
Down, down, never bring me down.
