<title>Stick To Your Guns â€“ Amber | Lyrics</title>
<meta name="description" content="Her name is amber / She has eyes like her mother / She's beautiful and bright the whole worlds in front of her / She has a smile that could end a war / Yet no one wants her and she has nothing to care for / Shes only 14 and she thinks / Why is the weight of the world crashing down on me / Cause as of late the sun doesn't seem to shine so bright / And the place where my heart once was has lost its fight / She's on her own / And as she's braves her storm / All alone / She screams oh / I've had enough please make this go / This sea is rough and I'm drowning slow / Her mind numbing pain has her lost in the undertow / I just wish she knew she didn't have to be alone / You don't have to be alone / You're not alone / You're not alone / Her arms are locked in the devils chains / And her heart, broken and trapped in a steel cage. / She can't catch her breath as she chokes on the pain / So she brings her pain to the surface of her skin. / Your frozen agony burns you. Can't even begin to know / The nightmare that you've been through. / Only you can break the cycle that plagues you / There is a light you just have to see it through. / She's on her own / And as she's braves her storm / All alone / She screams oh / I've had enough please make this go / This sea is rough and I'm drowning slow / Her mind numbing pain has her lost in the undertow / I just wish she knew she didn't have to be alone / She screams oh / I've had enough please make this go / This sea is rough and I'm drowning slow / Her mind numbing pain has her lost in the undertow / But braves her storm / You are not alone / ___________ / Name Amber / Artist Stick To Your Guns / Album The Hope Division"/>
