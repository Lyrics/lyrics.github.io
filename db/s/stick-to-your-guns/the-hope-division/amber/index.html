    <div class="view"><pre>Her name is amber
She has eyes like her mother
She's beautiful and bright the whole worlds in front of her
She has a smile that could end a war
Yet no one wants her and she has nothing to care for
Shes only 14 and she thinks
Why is the weight of the world crashing down on me
Cause as of late the sun doesn't seem to shine so bright
And the place where my heart once was has lost its fight

She's on her own
And as she's braves her storm
All alone

She screams oh
I've had enough please make this go
This sea is rough and I'm drowning slow
Her mind numbing pain has her lost in the undertow
I just wish she knew she didn't have to be alone

You don't have to be alone
You're not alone
You're not alone

Her arms are locked in the devils chains
And her heart, broken and trapped in a steel cage.
She can't catch her breath as she chokes on the pain
So she brings her pain to the surface of her skin.

Your frozen agony burns you. Can't even begin to know
The nightmare that you've been through.
Only you can break the cycle that plagues you
There is a light you just have to see it through.

She's on her own
And as she's braves her storm
All alone

She screams oh
I've had enough please make this go
This sea is rough and I'm drowning slow
Her mind numbing pain has her lost in the undertow
I just wish she knew she didn't have to be alone

She screams oh
I've had enough please make this go
This sea is rough and I'm drowning slow
Her mind numbing pain has her lost in the undertow
But braves her storm
You are not alone</pre></div>
