She thinks, "Another day I'm left to drag my broken soul
Through the streets, into work and school, then back home"
Not a man in her life that makes her feel whole
Because it's the men in her life that filled her with those holes.
"What have I done to deserve this?"
To face a raising fist that screams, "You think I like this bitch?!"
Don't you worry my darling, mommy just tripped
She can feel her sanity starting to slip
So she dreams, if I could just go...

Beyond the sun
Where I can't feel pain
Where I could just fade away
Beyond the sun, where no one lives but me
Help me

Entangled in a web of complete misery
Her cries are stifled by a fear of what he might do to the kids
"If i just stick it out this might end soon"
"This is all my fault,
If I had just done what he said I could have avoided this all"
And still she dreams, if I could just go...

Beyond the sun
Where I can't feel pain
Where I could just fade away
Beyond the sun, where no one lives but me
Help me

How can we let this be?
Our sister and mothers are dying
How can we let this be?
Our mother are dying
How can we let this be?
