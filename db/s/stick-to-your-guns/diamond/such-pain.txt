I don't think I could ever let you go
but if you stay I know that I'll lose control.
All the things that we've been through
I can't believe all I've done just to protect you.
Suffocated by the thin line I walk between
who I am and who I think I should be.
Pointed every finger I could still nothing's right to me.

I am the enemy.

Such Pain.
Climbs like ivy from my feet to my face.

My only enemy is me.
