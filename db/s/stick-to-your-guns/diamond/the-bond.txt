Yeah

It's hard to find a way to express myself,
But there's so much I owe to you.
The only ones who deserve to hate me
Are the ones that love me the most.

You are the ones.
And you deserve the same.
You are the ones.
The only ones who ever stayed.

I've learned so much from you and I
Will always walk right by your side.
Keeper, I will defend your name
Just like you've defended mine.

You are the ones
And you deserve the same.
You are the ones.
The only ones who ever stayed.

Unbroken
The bond between you and I
Will always remain unbroken
No matter what the bastards of time may bring
We will always remain unbroken
Unbroken
Unbroken
