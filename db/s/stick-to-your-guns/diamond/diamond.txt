I know that what's in front of me
Is a reflection of what is inside of me
And I see I need to be myself
'Cause it's so lonely in the eyes of someone else
And I feel, oh how I feel
Yeah I feel and I always will
I starve to live free from fear
To free myself before I disappear
I am forever more than just surviving
This is my life and this life is my diamond

My time, your time, our time is running out
My time, your time, our time is running out
My time, your time, our time is running out
My time, your time, our time is running out
