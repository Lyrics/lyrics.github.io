My friend, What has you so troubled?
Why have you turned life into such a struggle?
I see it in you no matter how hard it tries to hide;
The war in your heart and fire in your eyes.
I can't follow, trust me I've tried.
My path is lit by a brighter light.
I will always sing humanity's song,
We May fall but we will carry on.
May these words ring loud.
