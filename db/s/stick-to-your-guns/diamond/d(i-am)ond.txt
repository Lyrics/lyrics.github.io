I am a brave man, I am a coward
I am the tiger, I am the flower
I am honest, and I'm a liar
I am vital, I am tired
I am a free man, I am caught
From where I am, I see the top
I am, most importantly never concerned with what I am not.

(I am) A brave man, a coward
The tiger, the flower
(I am) Honest, a liar
I am vital and so fucking tired
(I am) A free man, I am caught
From where I am, I see the top
(I am) Most importantly never concerned with what I am not.

(I am) Forever more than just surviving
This is my life and this life is my diamond.
