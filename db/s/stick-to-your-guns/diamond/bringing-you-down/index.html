    <div class="view"><div id="lyrics">The rage that builds in us is bringing you down.

Chewed up and spit out, lost and alone.
Your jobs been ripped from you and on deck, your home.
Can't feed yourself, let alone feed the kids.
American dreams have turned to your American greed.
Their fingers are crossed while they smile and promise.
The wrong side of broke while our gold lines their pockets.
On the priority list we place dead last,
and their foreclosed signs line our "greener grass."
Look me in my eyes you crooked fuck.
Not one more god damn lie.
Your time is up.
The rage that builds in us is bringing you down.

Watch the weight of it all come crashing down.
United, now the kings will lose their crown.

Now we're shit out of luck and they don't give a fuck.
No they don't give a fuck.

Now the masses awaken.
The embodiment of sacrifice.
History in the making.
Witness defining moments of our lives.

Their fingers are crossed while they smile and promise.
The wrong side of broke while our gold lines their pockets.
On the priority list we place dead last,
and their foreclosed signs line our "greener grass."
Look me in my eyes you crooked fuck.
Not one more god damn lie.
Your time is up.
The rage that builds in us is bringing you down.

Watch the weight of it all come crashing down.
United, now the kings will lose their crown.

The rage that builds in us is bringing you down.</div></div>
