    <div class="view"><pre>Water was running, children were running
You were running out of time
Under the mountain, a golden fountain
Were you praying at the Lares shrine?

But oh, your city lies in dust, my friend
But oh, your city lies in dust, my friend

We found you hiding, we found you lying
Choking on the dirt and sand
Your former glories and all the stories
Dragged and washed with eager hands

But oh, your city lies in dust, my friend
But oh, your city lies in dust, my friend

Your city lies in dust

Water was running, children were running
We found you hiding, we found you lying
Water was running, children were running
We found you hiding, we found you lying

But oh, your city lies in dust, my friend
But oh, your city lies in dust, my friend

Hot and burning in your nostrils
Pouring down your gaping mouth
Your molten bodies blanket of cinders
Caught in the throes

And

But oh, your city lies in dust, my friend
But oh, your city lies in dust, my friend

But oh, your city lies in dust, my friend
But oh, your city lies in dust, my friend

Your city lies in dust, my friend

But oh, your city lies in dust, my friend
But oh, your city lies in dust, my friend</pre></div>
