<title>Slipknot – This Cold Black | Lyrics</title>
<meta name="description" content="Welcome out / Mother Nature is a coward (Mother Nature is a whore) / No more presence, no more power (I pray for death by the hour) / Cut another smile into me (Into me is all you are) / My artifice won't recognize me (You won't find me) anymore / Posttraumatic war machines / The pessimists still won't believe / Throw away my past mistakes / It's all I can to feel / Let my weapons be your children / Let my armies be your damned / Try to suffer on in silence / Try to stop me if you can / Pneumatic destroyer / Pathetic seducer / Distortion sufficient / Someday, one day, we'll live our lives again / My ghosts have found their way back home / I have every right to kill my own (I have every right to kill my own) / I am something now that never could exist / My anguish conquers all; pay the price and watch me fall / My only key is broken—my broken key is only... Me / Pneumatic destroyer / Pathetic seducer / Distortion sufficient / Someday, one day, we'll live our lives again / You utter waste of tired flesh / It doesn't matter if you can't progress / Even now, they still create me / Give me your ignorance; irritate me / I am made of the same debris / You want it all, but you didn't want me / Hypocrite with no real use / I'm alive; what's your excuse? / We'll live our lives again / _____________________ / Name This Cold Black / Artist Slipknot / Album All Hope Is Gone"/>
