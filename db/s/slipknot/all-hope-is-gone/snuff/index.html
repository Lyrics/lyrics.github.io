    <div class="view"><div id="lyrics">Bury all your secrets in my skin
Come away with innocence, and leave me with my sins
The air around me still feels like a cage
And love is just a camouflage, for what resembles rage again

So if you love me let me go
And run away before I know
My heart is just too dark to care
I can't destroy what isn't there

Deliver me unto my fate
If I'm alone I cannot hate
I don't deserve to have you
Ooh my smile was taken long ago, if I can change I hope I never know

I still press your letters to my lips
And cherish them in parts of me, that savor every kiss
I couldn't face a life without your light (without your light)
But all of that was ripped apart, when you refused to fight

So save your breath I will not hear
I think I made it very clear
You couldn't hate enough to love
Is that supposed to be enough

I only wish you weren't my friend
Then I could hurt you in the end
I never claimed to be a saint
Ooh my own was banished long ago, it took the death of hope to let you go

Oh oh

So break yourself against my stones
And spit your pity in my soul
You never needed any help
You sold me out to save yourself

And I won't listen to your shame
You ran away you're all the same
Angels lie to keep control
Ooh my love was punished long ago, if you still care don't ever let me know

If you still care don't ever let me know</div></div>
