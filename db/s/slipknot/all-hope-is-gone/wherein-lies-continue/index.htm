<div><pre>"Thou shalt not"

Kill your fathers, destroy another life
Question everything we clung to for years
Live forever, design a better death
Confuse a liar with a savior from fear.

Create a myth and separate the chosen ones
Adolescent independence dominion
I only wanna believe in fuckin' anything
But now my conscience is contradicting everything.

The ending's the same
The world will not change
The answer is clear.

Tell your mothers they have no sons or daughters
Blame yourselves because your children are mine
We are orphans, but we are not forgotten
And we will find a way to save us this time.

We can run, but we are tired of runnin'
We're droppin' seconds in a glass 'til we die
We only wanna believe in fuckin' everything
But we're alive and we're not accepting anything.

The ending's the same
The world will not change
The answer is clear
Annihilation.

I won't control or restrain things I do not understand
Now I realize I'm stronger, better
They gave to me now I give to you the means to burn the thoughts I had
Now I realize I'm stronger, better, more.

We have to save ourselves.
We have to save ourselves.

We have to save ourselves!
We have to save ourselves!
We have to save ourselves!
We have to save ourselves!

Oh, I will never become another piece
Inside the paralytic construct I hate.
Live forever? Well, I would rather die
At least I'd know I wasn't theirs to create.

This is yours, but you had better choose
Before they take away your right to decide
I guess I'll never believe in fuckin' anything
But my solace is, I can handle everything.

The ending's the same
The world will not change
The answer is clear
Obliteration.

I won't control or restrain things I do not understand
Now I realize I'm stronger, better
They gave to me, now I give to you
The means to burn the thoughts I had
Now I realize I'm stronger, better.

I won't control or restrain things I do not understand
Now I realize I'm stronger, better
They gave to me, now I give to you
The means to burn the thoughts I had
Now I realize I'm stronger, better, more.

We have to save ourselves!
We have to save ourselves!
We have to save ourselves!
We have to save ourselves!
We have to save ourselves!
We have to save ourselves!</pre></div>
