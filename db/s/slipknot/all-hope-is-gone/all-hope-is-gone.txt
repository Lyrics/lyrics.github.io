The State of the Nation, violation
A broken promise is as good as a lie
The Hell is humongous, the Devil's among us
And we will burn 'cause we won't unite

What are we conceding for freedom?
Why does anybody think we need 'em?
I would rather fight than let another die
We're the problem, but we're also the solution

All hope is gone

If you want it, come and take it from me
If you think you can you still don't know me
Let me tell you man, I said it, I meant it
And I will always have the right to defend it

Fifty seconds a hundred murders
The Bill of Rights is a bill of sale
What will you do when the war is over?
What will you do when your system fails?

We have made the present obsolete
What do you want? What do you need?
We'll find a way
When all hope is gone

We've seen the fall of the elite
Bury your life, take your disease
We'll end the world
When all hope is gone

We have made the present obsolete
What do you want? What do you need?
We'll find a way
When all hope is gone

We've seen the fall of the elite
Bury your life, take your disease
We'll end the world
When all hope is gone

The wretched are the wounded
The hungry starve to death
In a place where no one goes
The air itself is a final breath

So discontinue
The antiseptic care charade
As the cry of justice comes
A malignant fire fades

I am the reason your future suffers
I am the hatred you won't embrace
I am the worm of a pure gestation
I am the remedy spit in my face

All your laws and rules are outdated
All your subjects are killing the kings
I can rattle off a million other reasons why
But does it matter when the only thing we love will die?

We have made the present obsolete
What do you want? What do you need?
We'll find a way
When all hope is gone

We've seen the fall of the elite
Bury your life, take your disease
We'll end the world
When all hope is gone

We have made the present obsolete
What do you want? What do you need?
We'll find a way (we'll find a way)
When all hope is gone

We've seen the fall of the elite
Bury your life, take your disease
We'll end the world (we'll end the world)
When all hope is gone

When all hope is gone
When all hope is gone
When all hope is gone
