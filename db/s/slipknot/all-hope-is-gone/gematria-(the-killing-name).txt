That was all I got and now you got me
All I ever really wanted was to take the blame
I will go down in history and not down in flames

Meningitis, I will survive this
Dry sockets and a schizophrenic crisis
The time of The Nine has begun
Get out of the way or you will suffer as one!

This is so typical, apocalyptical
Hanging on abysmal release, Jesus
I don't need this, don't wanna be this
Icon in the making, my hands are fucking shaking!

What if God doesn't care?
What if God doesn't care?

Remember, surrender, the time is now
Continue, we're in you and we will burn your cities down

America is a killing name, it doesn't feel or discriminate
Life is just a killing field, it's all that's left, nothing's real
Throw away your disposable past and fall apart like a cigarette ash
We are the fatal and vital ones of the world
And we will burn your cities down

What if God doesn't care?
What if God doesn't care?

America is a killing name, it doesn't feel or discriminate
Life is just a killing field, it's all that's left, nothing's real
Throw away your disposable past and fall apart like a cigarette ash
We are the fatal and vital ones of the world
And we will burn your cities down

Down...

We will burn your cities down
We will burn your cities down
We will burn your cities down

Feed the hungry, feed them shit, feed them bones and politics
You wanna revolutionize? Be specific and believe your eyes!
Start a war in another backyard and we'll destroy your house of cards
Give me a minute and I'll change your mind, give me a bullet and I'll change your life

Remember, surrender, the time is now
Continue, we're in you and we will burn your cities down

America is a killing name, it doesn't feel or discriminate
Life is just a killing field, it's all that's left, nothing's real
Throw away your disposable past and fall apart like a cigarette ash
We are the fatal and vital ones of the world
And we will burn your cities down

Down...
Down...
We will burn your cities down!

Down...
Down...
We will burn your cities down!

America... what if God doesn't care?

What if God doesn't care?
