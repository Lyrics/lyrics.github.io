<title>Slipknot â€“ Sulfur | Lyrics</title>
<meta name="description" content="My guilt and my shame / Always sell me short, always feel the same / And my face and my soul / Always wear me thin, always under control / But the longest hours you'll have in your life / Are the ones you sit through to know if you're right / So I'll wait, but I'll pray that I'm wrong / Because I think I know what's going on! / So let me get this straight: The only will is my own? / I do whatever I want and stay alone? / All my decisions make it untouchable and tainted / I'm gonna suffer for the rest of my life / But I will always find a way to survive / I'm not a failure, but I know what it's like / I can take it or leave it, or die! / Stay, you don't always know where you stand, till you know that you won't run away / There's something inside me that feels like breathing in sulfur / Like breathing in sulfur! / My life is undone and I'm a sinner to most but a sage to some / And my gods are untrue, I'm probably wrong, but I'm better than you / And the longest hours I've had in my life, were the ones I went through to know I was right / So I'm safe, but I'm a little outside / I'm gonna laugh when I'm buried alive! / Stay, you don't always know where you stand, till you know that you won't run away / There's something inside me that feels like breathing in sulfur / Like breathing in sulfur! / Like breathing in sulfur! / Stay, you don't always know where you stand, till you know that you won't run away / There's something inside me that feels like breathing in sulfur / Like breathing in sulfur... / Stay, you don't always know where you stand, (You don't always know where you stand) / till you know that you won't run away / There's something inside me that feels (There's something inside me that feels) / like breathing in sulfur! / Like breathing in sulfur... / Like breathing in sulfur! / Like breathing in sulfur! / Like breathing in sulfur! / Like breathing in sulfur... / ____________ / Name Sulfur / Artist Slipknot / Album All Hope Is Gone"/>
