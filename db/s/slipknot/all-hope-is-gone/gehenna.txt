Do you believe? Do you fade like a Dream?
Let me hear you breathe
Let me watch as you sleep
The sparrow's eyes.... Promises shift into judgments
I cannot deny that you were designed for my punishments

The blood and the body
Control the cut so it's seamless
Show me your heart
Show me the way to complete this

Tethered to a scene I treasure; can you help me?
I sever God; it's perfect, it's never really perfect
Now... I can finally be myself
'Cause I don't want to be myself

Free my severed heart, give me you, I want it
(I don't want to be myself)

I cannot maintain
A semblance of normal anymore
I'd rather feel pain
Than try to fit in with you anymore

I'll throw it all away
Like everybody else
I can finally be myself
'Cause I don't want to be myself

Free my severed heart, give me you, I want it
(I don't want to be myself)
