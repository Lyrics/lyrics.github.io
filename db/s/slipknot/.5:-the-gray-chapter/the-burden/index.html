    <div class="view"><div id="lyrics">There's God
Can I feed you again?
Will I have to stay dumb?
You can feel and it begins

But I know inside this heart attack
I can see through your eyes
I'm terrified of everything
But it's no real surprise

Because the parasites are dancing closer
All this sacrilegion warns in posters
Can you handle it?

In the dark
Why I think I'm alone
I swept through my visions
I'm going too cold

Today is a tragedy
In the mouth of the mad
But that doesn't matter now
I've come home relaxed

I'm curled up in a ball and shaking
I'm hiding from the hell I'm making
I can't believe the chance I'm taking
Is there any other way?
Is there any other way?

The burden
The burden

(You can't save me)
There is nothing more to give
(I am changing)
Almost like I never lived
(Be my witness)
Just don't leave me in suspense
(Keep this, prove it)
Tell them all the consequences

The burden
(Have you ever been burdened before?)
The burden
(Was there anything you wanted more?)

(You can't save me)
There is nothing more to give
(I am changing)
Almost like I never lived
(Be my witness)
Just don't leave me in suspense
(Keep this, prove it)
Tell them all the consequences

Our same plea
By now you know that looks are deceiving
I'm covered in a rash and receding
Is there any other way?
Is there any other way?

For Gods' sakes we've suffered
This pain is now our lives
For Gods' sakes we've suffered enough

For Gods' sakes we've suffered
This pain is now our lives
For Gods' sakes we've suffered enough

For Gods' sakes we've suffered
This pain is now our lives
For Gods' sakes we've suffered enough

For Gods' sakes we've suffered
This pain is now our lives
For Gods' sakes we've suffered enough

Enough
Enough
Enough</div></div>
