Fire and caffeine, a lot of nicotine
I'm gonna burn so I better tell you everything
The competition, the superstition
Nevermind, 'cause you're never gonna give in

It's a crisis, just how you like it
The same drama in a different disguise
I'm bound to walk with a target on my back
At least I'm ready for another attack

The Lord of lies
The morning star
You had to be set free
Opposing sides
Your choices are
The negative one and me, yeah

Svengali; Why are we the enemies?
I never follow but I never make apologies
Your dementias are gonna getcha
Because your walls can't support each other

Settle for the cynical, you're so political
You're getting ready 'cause the first move is critical
Reciprocity, somebody's listening
What did we learn from our time in captivity?

The Lord of lies
The morning star
You had to be set free
Opposing sides
Your choices are
The negative one and me
The negative one and me

I hope you live to see the day
When you're world goes up in flames
And as you die you see my face
You're the only one to blame, yeah

Fuck
Yeah

The prescient, the nascent, the quotient (they all will fall)
The cystic symbolic condition (systemic)
Egregious, replete with these lesions (contaminate)
Succumb to the selfish creation (your failure)

Yeah

No accountability, divisibility
I point a finger but it's always looking back at me
The centipede's pulling on the mechanism
Unearthing scars of the cataclysm

When the innocent begin to circumvent
The colour fades, but the picture is vibrant
What do you believe? Does it matter now?
Turn away, the killer is disavowed

The Lord of lies
The morning star
You had to be set free
Opposing sides
Your choices are
The negative one and me
The negative one and me

I hope you live to see the day
When you're world goes up in flames
And as you die you see my face
You're the only one to blame

The Lord of lies (the lord of lies)
The morning star (the morning star)
You had to be set free
Opposing sides (opposing sides)
Your choices are (your choices are)
The negative one (the negative one)
The negative one (the negative one)
The negative one (the negative one)
The negative one
The negative one and me
The negative one and me
The negative one and me
Yeah
