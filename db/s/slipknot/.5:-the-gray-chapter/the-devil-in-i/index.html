<title>Slipknot â€“ The Devil In I | Lyrics</title>
<meta name="description" content="Undo these chains, my friend / I'll show you the rage I've hidden / Perish the sacrament / Swallow, but nothing's forgiven / You and I can't decide / Which of us was taken for granted / Make amends, some of us / Are destined to be outlived / Step inside; see the Devil in I / Too many times we've let it come to this / Step inside; see the Devil in I / You'll realize I'm not your devil anymore / Under the words of men / Something is tempting the father / Where is your will, my friend? / Instantiates never even bother / You and I, wrong or right / Traded a lie for the leverage / In between the lens in light / You're not what you seem / Step inside; see the Devil in I / Too many times we've let it come to this / Step inside; see the Devil in I / You'll realize I'm not your devil / I'm not your devil anymore / Your station is abandoned / Fooled you, 'cause I know what you've done / Sensation, deprivation / You should've burned when you turned on everyone / So step inside; see the Devil in I / Too many times we've let it come to this / Step inside; see the Devil in I / I know you'll find your answers in the end / Step inside; see the Devil in I / You'll realize I'm not your devil (Anymore) / So step inside, step inside / See the Devil in I, see the Devil in I / ____________________ / Name The Devil In I / Artist Slipknot / Album .5: The Gray Chapter"/>
