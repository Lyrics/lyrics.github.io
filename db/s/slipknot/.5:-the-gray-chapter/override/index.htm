<div><pre>The ghosts have given up
Familiar haunts have had enough
Too much thought will give you doubt
And now they found you

It's safer in a cage
They can't tell you what to say
All your dreams come with a price
So they own you

But what did you expect?
Was it too much to protect?
Did you understand they had selfish intentions?
When they were pulling you in opposite directions

You don't know the hell that's coming
Everybody get on the ground
You don't know the hell that's coming
Everybody get on the ground

We are the override
Oh, we are the override

The dead don't know, the dead are lonely
A fascination fades
When this mercy execution
Says it's over

You follow as preferred
Now their plans are undeterred
Who can bring them in to supersede?
It's over

Even hate starts out as love
Sometimes when it's all you want
Maybe satisfaction will take you for granted
When all that's left is the emotion you abandoned

You don't know the hell that's coming
Everybody get on the ground
You don't know the hell that's coming
Everybody get on the ground

We are the override
Oh, we are the override, yeah

You clawed out from nothing and I sent you back
Floor to the pedal and lock what you act
Covered in sores, you cannot be the one
You are the answer to why we have risen

You are not the way
You are judged to being afraid
You are simple and unchanged
We believe you should give up
Give up
Give up

God and his mercy will take you for granted
When all that's left is the life you abandoned

You don't know the hell that's coming
Everybody get on the ground
You don't know the hell that's coming
Everybody get on the ground

We are the override
Oh, we are the override, yeah

Give up
Give up
Give up
Give up
Give up
Give up
Give up
Give up
Give up</pre></div>
