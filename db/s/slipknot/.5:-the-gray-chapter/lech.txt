I know why Judas wept, motherfucker!

The fire's burn on the summit
Shining a light on the ones I've killed
Survivors' guilt undetermined
I can murder the world in all the blood I've spilled

Banishment, sequestered and conquered
To hell with your intelligence
Just figure out your common sense
No one is bulletproof

Yeah

I'll eat the skins of my brothers
The alabaster bones will make a perfect wall
Can I fill in the cracks with these feelings
With every terrible piece or maybe nothing at all

Selfishness, take granted for everything
What more could you ask for?
It doesn't matter anymore
No one is bulletproof

Yeah

Can you feel the cold?
Fortune never favors the old
Tired of defending myself
Go complain to somebody else
Somebody else

Yeah

The monsters in your madness are the voices in your head
They're scratching at your windows as you hide beneath the bed
You live like fucking heathens, so you'll die like pagan Gods
In between the poisons and the pure
Contagions and the cure

NINE - FOR - SURE
NINE - FOR - SURE
NINE - FOR - SURE
NINE - FOR - SURE

I got a bone that's dead inside of me
It's a rotting sink that I don't need
Feel free to vent your denigration
I can't believe I'm saying this

I'll live with my regrets
I'll die by my decisions
I'm not your fucking superstar
Keep it close, you're going way too far

No one is bulletproof
Bulletproof
No one is bulletproof
Bulletproof
No one is bulletproof
Bulletproof
