    <div class="view"><pre>It's been years since anyone could be a friend
It's the fear that kills the feeling, in the end
Can we face it? Can we shape it? Can we really die?
If rain is what you want, all you have to do is close your eyes
Just close your eyes

I am watching resurrections start to crawl
Is there any chance in Hell? Any chance at all?
Do we need it? Do we see it? Is it really there?
If rain is what you want, then take your seats, enjoy the fall
Enjoy the fall

The only thing deeper than my last breath
The only thing darker than my last death
Is the panic, the static
I've come back from the dead
But my cities will never sleep again

In these diamonds we're left with coloured glass
As pressure takes its toll, we will outlast

But you can't break my heart
As long as I can be myself, I'll never fall apart
And you can't take me in
If I'm not broken, break me down
So I will never feel alone again

The only thing deeper than my last breath
The only thing darker than my last death
Is the panic, the static
I've come back from the dead
But my cities (will never sleep again)

My cities will never sleep again
My cities will never sleep again
My cities will never sleep again
My cities will never sleep again</pre></div>
