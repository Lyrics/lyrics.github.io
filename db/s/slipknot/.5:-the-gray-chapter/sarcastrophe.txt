Wallow in the winter of it
Discover what you truly covet
Underneath and far above it
You slither in all kinds of shit

How could you forget about it?
Did you think you could minimize?
This is the age of consent
You'll get a day in the sun before I kill your fucking lights

Burn up in your atmosphere
Burn up in your utmost fear

Desecrate your temples
Only Hell and hate remain
Don't look for crows to scatter
Prepare for Judgement Day

We are kill gods!

The kings are falling down
Can I find a way to get there?
Bury your head in the ground
Will you falsify for your fair share?

When it's done, it's done - plus negative one
It's everybody's guess but the apathy won
Will you come testify in the court of myopic opinion
Or will you settle for oblivion?

We are kill gods!

(We) We make this world worth saving
(Are) Are you prepared to believe?
(Kill) Kill everything that kills you
(Gods) Live long and die for me
Yeah

Rape crutch and stick in the middle
Of an evidence bag that'll never obey
All these years spent hiding all the bodies
I could never be sure, but I remember the graves

We are kill gods!

(We) We make this world worth saving
(Are) Are you prepared to believe?
(Kill) Kill everything that kills you
(Gods) Live long and die for me

You!

Live long and die for me
Live long and die for me
