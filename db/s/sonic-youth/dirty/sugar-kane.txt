You're perfect in the way
A perfect end today
You're burning out their lights
And burning in their eyes
I love you, sugar kane
A-comin' from the rain
Oh, kiss me like a frog
And turn me into flame
I love you all the time
I need you 8 to 9
And I can stay all night
Your body shining

And I know
There's something down there, sugar soul
Back to the cross a twisted lane
There's something down there, sugar kane

I'm back again in love
I'm back again a dove
Where'd you get your light
Your smilin' sugar life
Another lovers day
Another cracked up night
Every night I say
The light is coming

And I know
There's something down there, sugar cone
Back to the cross a twisted lane
There's something down there, sugar kane

Hey angel, come and play
And fly me away
A stroll along the beach
Until you're out of time
I love you, sugar kane
A crack into the dream
I love you, sugar kane
I love you, sugar kane
I love you, sugar kane
I love you, sugar kane
I love you, sugar kane
I love you, sugar
