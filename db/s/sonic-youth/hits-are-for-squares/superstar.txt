Long ago
And oh so far away
I fell in love with you
Before the second show
Your guitar
It sounds so sweet and clear
But you're not really there
It's just the radio

Don't you remember you told me you love me baby
You said you'd be coming back this way again baby
Baby baby baby baby oh baby
I love you, I really do

Loneliness, is such a sad affair
And I can hardly wait
To be with you again
What to say
To make you come again
Come back to me again
And play your sad guitar

Don't you remember you told me you love me baby
You said you'd be coming back this way again baby
Baby baby baby baby oh baby
I love you, I really do

Don't you remember you told me you love me baby
You said you'd be coming back this way again baby
Baby baby baby baby oh baby
I love you, I really do
