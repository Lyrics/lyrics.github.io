    <div class="view"><div id="lyrics">You're it - no, you're it
Yeah, you're really it - you're it
No, I mean it, you're it
Say it, don't spray it
Spirit desire, face me
Spirit desire, don't displace me
Spirit desire, we will fall
Miss me, don't dismiss me
Spirit desire
Spirit desire, spirit desire
Spirit desire, we will fall
Spirit desire, we will fall
Spirit desire, spirit desire
Spirit desire, we will fall
Spirit desire, we will fall

Everybody's talking 'bout the stormy weather and what's a man to do but work out whether it's true?
Looking for a man with a focus and a temper who can open up a map and see between one and two

Time to get it before you let it get to you
Here he comes now. Stick to your guns and let him through

Everybody's coming from the winter vacation, taking in the sun in a exaltation to you
You come running in on platform shoes with Marshall stacks to at least just give us a clue

Ah, here it comes. I know it's someone I knew
Teenage riot in a public station, gonna fight and tear it up in a hyper-nation for you

Now I see it I think I'll leave it out of the way
Now I come near you and it's not clear why you fade away

Looking for a ride to your secret location where the kids are setting up a free-speed nation for you
Got a foghorn and a drum and a hammer that's rocking and a cord and a pedal and a lock, that'll do me for now

It better work out. I hope it works out my way
'Cause it's getting kind of quiet in my city head takes a teenage riot to get me out of bed right now

You better look it, we're gonna shake it up to him
He acts the hero, we paint a zero on his hand

We know it's down. We know it's bound too loose
Everybody's sound is around it, everybody wants to be proud to choose
So who's to take the blame for the stormy weather, you're never gonna stop all the teenage leather and booze

It's time to go 'round. A one man showdown, teach us how to fail
We're off the streets now and back on the road on the riot trail</div></div>
