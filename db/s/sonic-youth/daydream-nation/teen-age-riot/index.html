Stick to your guns and let him through</p><p>Everybody's coming from the winter vacation, taking in the sun in a exaltation to you<br/>You come running in on platform shoes with Marshall stacks to at least just give us a clue</p><p>Ah, here it comes. I know it's someone I knew<br/>Teenage riot in a public station, gonna fight and tear it up in a hyper-nation for you</p><p>Now I see it I think I'll leave it out of the way<br/>Now I come near you and it's not clear why you fade away</p><p>Looking for a ride to your secret location where the kids are setting up a free-speed nation for you<br/>Got a foghorn and a drum and a hammer that's rocking and a cord and a pedal and a lock, that'll do me for now</p><p>It better work out.

We know it's bound too loose<br/>Everybody's sound is around it, everybody wants to be proud to choose<br/>So who's to take the blame for the stormy weather, you're never gonna stop all the teenage leather and booze</p><p>It's time to go 'round. A one man showdown, teach us how to fail<br/>We're off the streets now and back on the road on the riot trail</p></article></div>
