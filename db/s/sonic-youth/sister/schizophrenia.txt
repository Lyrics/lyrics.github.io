I went away to see an old friend of mine
His sister came over, she was out of her mind
She said Jesus had a twin who knew nothing about sin
She was laughing like crazy at the trouble I'm in
Her light eyes were dancing
She is insane
Her brother says she's just a bitch with a golden chain
She keeps coming closer, saying "I can feel it in my bones
Schizophrenia is taking me home"

My future is static
It's already had it
I could tuck you in
And we can talk about it
I had a dream
And it split the scene
But I got a hunch
It's coming back to me
