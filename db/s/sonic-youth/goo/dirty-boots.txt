Here we go to another candle I know
All the girls there playin' on a jelly roll

Time to take a ride
Time to take it in a midnight eye
And if you wanna go, get on below
Pinkin' out the day, dreamin' out the crazy way
Finger on the love, it's all above

Everywhere it's six-sex-six by luck
A satellite wish will make it just enough
You be makin' out with a witch in a coffee truck

Time to rock the road, and tell the story of the jelly rollin'
Dirty boots are on, hi-de-ho
Pinkin' out the black, dreamin' in a crack
Satan got her tongue, now it's undone

I got some dirty boots
Yeah, dirty boots
I got some dirty boots, baby, dirty boots
Ha
