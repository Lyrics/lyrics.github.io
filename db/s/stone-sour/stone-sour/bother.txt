Wish I was too dead to cry?
My self-affliction fades
Stones to throw at my Creator
Masochists to which I cater

You don't need to bother
I don't need to be
I'll keep slipping farther
But once I hold on
I won't let go till it bleeds

Wish I was too dead to care?
If indeed, I cared at all
Never had a voice to protest
So you fed me shit to digest
I wish I had a reason, my flaws are open season
For this I gave up trying, one good turn deserves my dying

You don't need to bother
I don't need to be
I'll keep slipping farther
But once I hold on
I won't let go till it bleeds

Wish I'd died instead of lived?
A zombie hides my face
Shell, forgotten with its memories
Diaries left with cryptic entries

And you don't need to bother
I don't need to be (I don't need to be)
I'll keep slipping farther
But once I hold on
I won't let go till it bleeds

You don't need to bother
I don't need to be, yeah (I don't need to be)
I'll keep slipping farther
But once I hold on (once I hold on)
I'll never live down my deceit
