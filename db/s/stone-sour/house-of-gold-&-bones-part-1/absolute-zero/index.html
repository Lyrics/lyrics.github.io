    <div class="view"><div id="lyrics">The bloody angle, the symmetry
Your cheap adhesive isn't holding me
My mouth is a gun I can shoot
I can show you the truth
And I don't need a reason to lie to you

No pun intended, no punishment
If I offended you, you needed it
Ideas are the bombs in your mind, a fissure in time
If you don't have a weapon, you can't have mine

I can bleed if I want to bleed
I can fail if I feel the need
This face is my last confession
This life, it feels like a prison

Oh, I'm not afraid
I'm giving into grievances again
You're looking at an absolute zero
I'm not the Devil, but I won't be your hero

The catatonic, the sacrilege
Your primadonnas are a privilege
My god has a need to react, it's as simple as that
It's better just to settle than face the facts

I can bleed if I want to bleed
I can fail if I feel the need
This face is my last confession
This life, it feels like a prison

Oh, I'm not afraid
I'm giving into grievances again
You're looking at an absolute zero
I'm not the Devil, but I won't be your hero

One thing that I can't stand is when the minutes fight the second hand
I'll waste a lifetime's worth just to cling to one more day

No fucking quarter, no premiums
The world is stuck in delirium
"Man" is a four-letter word, it's really absurd
The hate isn't fake, it's just inferred

Oh, I'm not afraid
I'm giving into grievances again
I'm down to absolute zero
Another zealot with the weight of the fucking world
Oh, I'm not afraid
And I will let you down as I hold you in
You're looking at an absolute zero
I'm not the Devil, but I won't be your hero</div></div>
