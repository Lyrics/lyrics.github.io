<div><pre>I'm looking at you through the glass
Don't know how much time has passed
Oh God, it feels like forever
But no one ever tells you that
Forever feels like home
Sitting all alone inside your head

'Cause I'm looking at you through the glass
Don't know how much time has passed
All I know is that it feels like forever
But no one ever tells you that
Forever feels like home
Sitting all alone inside your head

How do you feel? That is the question
But I forget you don't expect an easy answer
When something like a soul becomes initialized
And folded up like paper dolls and little notes
You can't expect a bit of hope
So while you're outside looking in
Describing what you see
Remember what you're staring at is me

'Cause I'm looking at you through the glass
Don't know how much time has passed
All I know is that it feels like forever
But no one ever tells you that
Forever feels like home
Sitting all alone inside your head

How much is real? So much to question
An epidemic of the mannequins
Contaminating everything
We thought came from the heart
But never did right from the start
Just listen to the noises
Null and void instead of voices
Before you tell yourself
It's just a different scene
Remember it's just different from what you've seen

I'm looking at you through the glass
Don't know how much time has passed
And all I know is that it feels like forever
But no one ever tells you that
Forever feels like home
Sitting all alone inside your head

'Cause I'm looking at you through the glass
Don't know how much time has passed
And all I know is that it feels like forever
But no one ever tells you that
Forever feels like home
Sitting all alone inside your head

And it's the stars, the stars
That shine for you
And it's the stars, the stars
That lie to you, yeah yeah

And it's the stars, the stars
That shine for you
And it's the stars, the stars
That lie to you, yeah

I'm looking at you through the glass
Don't know how much time has passed
Oh God, it feels like forever
But no one ever tells you that
Forever feels like home
Sitting all alone inside your head

'Cause I'm looking at you through the glass
Don't know how much time has passed
All I know is that it feels like forever
But no one ever tells you that
Forever feels like home
Sitting all alone inside your head

And it's the stars, the stars
That shine for you, yeah
And it's the stars, the stars
That lie to you, yeah

And it's the stars, the stars
That shine for you, yeah
And it's the stars, the stars
That lie to you, yeah

Oh and the stars
Oh and the stars, they lie</pre></div>
