That is the question<br/>But I forget you don't expect an easy answer<br/>When something like a soul becomes initialized<br/>And folded up like paper dolls and little notes<br/>You can't expect a bit of hope<br/>So while you're outside looking in<br/>Describing what you see<br/>Remember what you're staring at is me</p><p>'Cause I'm looking at you through the glass<br/>Don't know how much time has passed<br/>All I know is that it feels like forever<br/>But no one ever tells you that<br/>Forever feels like home<br/>Sitting all alone inside your head</p><p>How much is real? So much to question<br/>An epidemic of the mannequins<br/>Contaminating everything<br/>We thought came from the heart<br/>But never did right from the start<br/>Just listen to the noises<br/>(Null and void instead of voices)<br/>Before you tell yourself<br/>It's just a different scene<br/>Remember it's just different from what you've seen</p><p>I'm looking at you through the glass<br/>Don't know how much time has passed<br/>And all I know is that it feels like forever<br/>But no one ever tells you that<br/>Forever feels like home<br/>Sitting all alone inside your head</p><p>'Cause I'm looking at you through the glass<br/>Don't know how much time has passed<br/>And all I know is that it feels like forever<br/>But no one ever tells you that<br/>Forever feels like home<br/>Sitting all alone inside your head</p><p>And it's the stars, the stars<br/>That shine for you<br/>And it's the stars, the stars<br/>That lie to you, yeah yeah</p><p>And it's the stars, the stars<br/>That shine for you<br/>And it's the stars, the stars<br/>That lie to you, yeah</p><p>I'm looking at you through the glass<br/>Don't know how much time has passed<br/>Oh God, it feels like forever<br/>But no one ever tells you that<br/>Forever feels like home<br/>Sitting all alone inside your head</p><p>'Cause I'm looking at you through the glass<br/>Don't know how much time has passed<br/>All I know is that it feels like forever<br/>But no one ever tells you that<br/>Forever feels like home<br/>Sitting all alone inside your head</p><p>And it's the stars, the stars<br/>That shine for you, yeah<br/>And it's the stars, the stars<br/>That lie to you, yeah</p><p>And it's the stars, the stars<br/>That shine for you, yeah<br/>And it's the stars, the stars<br/>That lie to you, yeah</p><p>Oh and the stars<br/>Oh and the stars, they lie</p></article></div>
