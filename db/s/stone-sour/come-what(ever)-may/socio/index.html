<title>Stone Sour â€“ Socio | Lyrics</title>
<meta name="description" content="I remember now, but I still have my doubts / I think it's gonna be today / Everybody came, but it's just not the same / Why did it have to be today? / Now my chest is tight / No, I am not all right / It doesn't have to be this way / Why does it have to be this way? / I don't know what's wrong, / It's like I'm too far gone / It doesn't matter anyway / Fear is in my heart, just when I stop, it starts / And I can never live this way / Freedom in a cage, no sun and too much rage / I don't know how much I can take / Push it down inside, but it know just where I hide / I know that "normal" is hard to fake / Bleeding into life, it's like a thousand knives / Are slowly turning me to this / Why does it have to be like this? / I don't know what's wrong, / It's like I'm too far gone / It doesn't matter anyway / Fear is in my heart, just when I stop, it starts / And I can never live this way / I don't know what's wrong, / It's like I'm too far gone / It doesn't matter anyway / Fear is in my heart, just when I stop, it starts / And I can never live this way / I lost again today / I lost again, / I lost again today / I lost again, / I lost again today / I don't know what's wrong, / It's like I'm too far gone / It doesn't matter anyway / Fear is in my heart, just when I stop, it starts / And I can never live this way / Living with a curse, sometimes it's even worse / It slowly kills me everyday / Something I despise is gonna take my life / I guess I'll try again today / ___________ / Name Socio / Artist Stone Sour / Album Come What(ever) May"/>
