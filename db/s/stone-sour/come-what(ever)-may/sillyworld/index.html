When someone takes your word away, it's seldom ever heard
So take a sentence full of things you're not supposed to say
Carry on, but don't write 'em down, or you'll be gone

Love is just a song today, love is just a song
When someone takes the song away, you seldom sing along
So take those lyrics serious and sing your life away
Carry on, but don't write 'em down, or they'll be gone

All we ever do is talk; we like to ride, but we never walk
We make it so damn easy, we get bored
Why can't anybody see, what's good for you is good for me?
I can't take your silly world
I can't take your silly world no more

Peace is just two fingers now, peace was just a face
When someone put it on a shirt, you knew to count the days
So take those fingers, tape 'em up, and shove 'em up your ass
And carry on, but don't try it now, 'cause peace is gone

All we ever do is talk; we like to ride, but we never walk
We make it so damn easy, we get bored
Why can't anybody see, what's good for you is bad for me?
I can't take your silly world
I can't take your silly world no more

We fight our instincts
We go to extremes
We fight our instincts
We go to extremes

We fight our lives
We fight our lives
We fight our lives
We fight our lives
We fight our lives
We fight our lives
We fight our lives
We fight our

We fight our lives
We fight our lives
We fight our lives
We fight our lives
We fight our lives
We fight our lives</div></div>
