    <div class="view"><div id="lyrics">This fluid feels like pain, this stoic mood is all in vain
I reach into the dark, I tear this other me apart
How many years ago, how many deaths I can't let go?
My flesh is temporary, my god, extraordinary

You can't kill my mind

A man delivered, can never make his way in darkness
I know tonight will end,
But I won't give this life away again

Sifting through this same debris, oh my father, call to me
This smoke is in my blood, this home is just no good
Save me from my bitterness, give me up, I did my best
Shock this system full of shit, mock this fucker lost in it

You can't kill my mind

A man delivered, can never make his way in darkness
I know tonight will end, but I won't give this life away
I won't give this life away again

A man surrendered, can never find his own forgiveness
I know my life will end,
But I won't give tonight away
I won't give tonight away again

Oh yeahh!

This fluid feels like pain
This ruin feels like rain
I reach into the past
My future's fading fast
How many years ago
How many I let go
My flesh is all I have
My face in happenstance
This smoke is in my blood
This life is not enough
This life is not enough
This life is not enough</div></div>
