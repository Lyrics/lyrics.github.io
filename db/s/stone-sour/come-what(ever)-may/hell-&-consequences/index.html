<title>Stone Sour â€“ Hell & Consequences | Lyrics</title>
<meta name="description" content="I'm not a victim 'til I let you take me down / I'm not a target in the sights of your mercy / I never asked for anything, I'm not asking now / I will not be afraid, I will not be afraid / I've done this on my own, and I don't care what you do to me / I won't hand over what is mine / I've done this for too long to let you take it away from me / It's too late to stop me 'cause I refuse to die / I haven't weakened just because I've shown myself / I've taken everything except what's for granted / I'll leave hypocrisy for everybody else / I will not be afraid, I will not be afraid / I've done this on my own, and I don't care what you do to me / I won't hand over what is mine / I've done this for too long to let you take it away from me / It's too late to stop me 'cause I refuse to die / I'm not a problem 'til you make one out of spite / I'll give you hell and consequences for trying / If you don't want an enemy, don't fuck with my life! / I will not be afraid - I will not be afraid / I've done this on my own, and I don't care what you do to me / I won't hand over what is mine / I've done this for too long to let you take it away from me / It's too late to stop me 'cause I refuse to die / I've done this on my own, and I don't care what you do to me / I won't hand over what is mine / I've done this for too long to let you take it away from me / It's too late to stop me 'cause I refuse, I refuse to die / I refuse to die / _________________________ / Name Hell & Consequences / Artist Stone Sour / Album Come What(ever) May / Original text by Corey Taylor, James Root, / James Donald Root, Josh Rand, Shawn Economaki"/>
