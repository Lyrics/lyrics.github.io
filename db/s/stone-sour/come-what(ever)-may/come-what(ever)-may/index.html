    <div class="view"><pre>Can you take away every single day
That we have given to another false prophet?
Can you give us all a reason not to fall
Before you take away another broken promise?

Show your pretty face
Hide the bitter taste
You're still the rapist of an entire nation
You wanna be the man?
You gotta be a man
But you are nothing but a sad insinuation

How can we ever live this down?
How can we ever live this down?

Keep your fingers crossed, the truth is at a loss
Big decision for an ordinary coward
The only problem is your fuckin' rhetoric
We're more in danger than before you took power

Now it's just a game
God, you'll never change
You'd sell us out if you could only find a buyer
You don't give a shit
As long as idiots are in your corner, you could set us all on fire

How can we ever live this down?
How can we ever live this down?

You never wanted to be
They only wanted a parody
You want the world to be free?
What the hell is free about it?

Now we've reached the end, just get it over with
But this is building to an adamant conclusion
Come whatever may, there's gonna be a day
When we have figured out a plausible solution

Everything you've done is killing everyone
A little smile on a homicidal bastard
You wanna be the man?
You better have a plan
Another failure is a guaranteed disaster

How can we ever live this down?
How can we ever live this down?

You never wanted to be,
They only wanted a parody
You want the world to be free?
You only wanted the world...

You never wanted to be,
They only wanted a parody
You want the world to be free?
What the fuck is free about it?

What the fuck is free about it?
What the fuck is free about it?</pre></div>
