    <div class="view"><pre>It seems like everyday's the same
And I'm left to discover on my own
It seems like everything is gray
And there's no color to behold
They say it's over and I'm fine again, yeah
Try to stay sober, feels like I'm dying here

And I am aware now of how
Everything's gonna be fine
One day, too late, I'm in hell
I am prepared now
Seems everyone's gonna be fine
One day, too late, just as well

I feel the dream in me expire
And there's no one left to blame it on
I hear you label me a liar
'Cause I can't seem to get this through
You say it's over, I can sigh again, yeah
Why try to stay sober when I'm dying here

And I am aware now of how
Everything's gonna be fine
One day, too late, I'm in hell
I am prepared now
Seems everyone's gonna be fine
One day, too late, just as well

And I'm not scared now
I must assure you
You're never gonna get away
And I'm not scared now
And I'm not scared now, no

I am aware now of how
Everything's gonna be fine
One day, too late, I'm in hell
I am prepared now
Seems everyone's gonna be fine
One day, too late, just as well

I am prepared now
Seems everything's gonna be fine
For me, for me, for myself
For me, for me, for myself
For me, for me, for myself
I am prepared now for myself
I am prepared now, and I am fine again</pre></div>
