<title>Seether â€“ Fine Again | Lyrics</title>
<meta name="description" content="It seems like everyday's the same / And I'm left to discover on my own / It seems like everything is gray / And there's no color to behold / They say it's over and I'm fine again, yeah / Try to stay sober, feels like I'm dying here / And I am aware now of how / Everything's gonna be fine / One day, too late, I'm in hell / I am prepared now / Seems everyone's gonna be fine / One day, too late, just as well / I feel the dream in me expire / And there's no one left to blame it on / I hear you label me a liar / 'Cause I can't seem to get this through / You say it's over, I can sigh again, yeah / Why try to stay sober when I'm dying here / And I am aware now of how / Everything's gonna be fine / One day, too late, I'm in hell / I am prepared now / Seems everyone's gonna be fine / One day, too late, just as well / And I'm not scared now / I must assure you / You're never gonna get away / And I'm not scared now / And I'm not scared now, no / I am aware now of how / Everything's gonna be fine / One day, too late, I'm in hell / I am prepared now / Seems everyone's gonna be fine / One day, too late, just as well / I am prepared now / Seems everything's gonna be fine / For me, for me, for myself / For me, for me, for myself / For me, for me, for myself / I am prepared now for myself / I am prepared now, and I am fine again / ________________ / Name Fine Again / Artist Seether / Album Disclaimer II"/>
