    <div class="view"><pre>Will I fall again into dismay
Will I be ashamed, of cryin'
And I know it's never been the way that I described
But I am afraid, of tryin'

She's the one who keeps me all excited
She keeps me beggin' for more
She's the one who deems me uninvited
Now it's over

Never leave me, and don't deceive me
I'll keep on crawlin' my friend
Never tease me, and don't leave me here
It's all the same in the end

Now I find that I am weaker fare
That I am ashamed, of lyin'
And I know things never feel the way that's right inside
And I am afraid, of dyin'

'Cause you're the one who keeps me all excited
You keep me beggin' for more
You're the one who keeps me uninvited
Now it's over

Never leave me, and don't deceive me
I'll keep on crawlin' my friend
Never tease me, and don't leave me here
It's all the same in the end

Never leave me, and don't deceive me
I'll keep on crawlin' my friend

It's only a symbol
You've got me fallin' away
And I am afraid
Take back what I said

Never leave me, and don't deceive me
I'll keep on crawlin' my friend
Never tease me, and don't leave me here
It's all the same in the end

Never leave me, and don't deceive me
I'll keep on crawlin' my friend
Never tease me, and don't leave me here
It's all the same in the end

It's all the same in the end
It's all the same in the end
It's all the same in the end
It's only a symbol</pre></div>
