I am a plastic man
Wish I could be the one you could be proud of
I'm losing heart again
Wish I could show you what you think I'm made of

Someday I know I'll find my place
Someday I know this pain will fade

I am a perfect sale
Just wrap me up with your bow and flowers
I will neglect to tell
I'll sell your story that we love each other

Someday I know I'll find my place
Someday I know this pain will fade
Someday I know I'll find my place
Someday I'll sing my last refrain

Why don't you let me be
And I'll pretend I'm well
'Cause you're too blind to see
And I'm too tired to tell

And in your apathy
Your head begins to swell
Another tragedy
That you're too cold to feel

Someday I know I'll find my place
Someday I know this pain will fade
Someday I know I'll find my place
Someday I'll sing my last refrain
