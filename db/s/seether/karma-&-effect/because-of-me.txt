Here she comes again
She's feeling like she's already won
I believe it's gonna end again
All for naught
My philosophy is things are just as wrong as they seem
I believe it's gonna end this way
Atrocity

Do you believe in love
Like I believe in pain
Nobody died for you
Somebody pray for me

When you see me cut me down
And I will force it underground
There's no one left to hurt but me
And it's because of me
Right

There he walks away
He's feeling like he's having them on
I believe he's gonna bend again
And all for naught
My philosophy is things are just as wrong as they seem
I've gotta get you off of me
It's an oddity

Do you believe in love
Like I believe in pain
Nobody died for you
Somebody pray for me

When you see me cut me down
And I will force it underground
There's no one left to hurt but me
And it's because of me
Right

I want to see you suffer
Suffer

When you see me cut me down
And I will force it underground
There's no one left to hurt but me
And it's because of me
Right

When you see me cut me down
And when you see me cut me down
And when you see me cut me down
And it's because of me

Suffer
