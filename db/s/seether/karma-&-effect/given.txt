Trust all the things
I tell you are true
Dress up in your best
So I can be proud of you
And never believe I won't turn on you
And never believe I do this for you

You're leading me on again
And I find it
Yeah, I like it
And I'm reeling in awe for sure
Now I know it was given to me
Given to me

How I wish I could be rid of this ennui
Make you regret and make you afraid of me
And never believe I do this for me
And never believe I'll do this gently

You're leading me on again
And I find it
Yeah, I like it
And I'm reeling in awe for sure
Now I know it was given to me
Given to me

You're leading me on again
And I find it
Yeah, I like it
And I'm reeling in awe for sure
Now I know it was given to me
Given to me

Can't believe in broken promises
And render conscious all of me
I'll tell you it's all for you
Then deny it

You're leading me on again
And I find it
Yeah, I like it
And I'm reeling in awe for sure
Now I know it was given to me
Given to me

You're leading me on again
And I find it
Yeah, I like it
And I'm reeling in awe for sure
Now I know it was given to me
Given to me

It's all for me
