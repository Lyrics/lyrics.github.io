<title>Seether â€“ Remedy | Lyrics</title>
<meta name="description" content="Throw your dollar bills and leave your thrills all here with me / And speak but don't pretend I won't defend you anymore, you see / It aches in every bone, I'll die alone, but not for you / My eyes don't need to see that ugly thing, I know it's me you fear / If you want me hold me back / Frail, the skin is dry and pale / The pain will never fail / And so we go back to the remedy / Clip the wings that get you high / Just leave them where they lie / And tell yourself, "You'll be the death of me" / I don't need a friend, I need to mend so far away / So come sit by the fire and play a while, but you can't stay too long / It aches in every bone, I'll die alone, but not for pleasure / I see my heart explode, it's been eroded by the weather here / If you want me hold me back / Frail, the skin is dry and pale / The pain will never fail / And so we go back to the remedy / Clip the wings that get you high / Just leave them where they lie / And tell yourself, "You'll be the death of me" / Frail, the skin is dry and pale / The pain will never fail / And so we go back to the remedy / Clip the wings that get you high / Just leave them where they lie / And tell yourself, "You'll be the death of me" / Hold your eyes closed, take me in / Hold your eyes closed, take me in / Frail, the skin is dry and pale / The pain will never fail / And so we go back to the remedy / Clip the wings that get you high / Just leave them where they lie / And tell yourself, "You'll be the death of me" / Frail, the skin is dry and pale / The pain will never fail / And so we go back to the remedy / Clip the wings that get you high / Just leave them where they lie / And tell yourself, "You'll be the death of me" / ____________ / Name Remedy / Artist Seether / Album Karma & Effect"/>
