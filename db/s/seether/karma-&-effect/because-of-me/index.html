<title>Seether â€“ Because Of Me | Lyrics</title>
<meta name="description" content="Here she comes again / She's feeling like she's already won / I believe it's gonna end again / All for naught / My philosophy is things are just as wrong as they seem / I believe it's gonna end this way / Atrocity / Do you believe in love / Like I believe in pain / Nobody died for you / Somebody pray for me / When you see me cut me down / And I will force it underground / There's no one left to hurt but me / And it's because of me / Right / There he walks away / He's feeling like he's having them on / I believe he's gonna bend again / And all for naught / My philosophy is things are just as wrong as they seem / I've gotta get you off of me / It's an oddity / Do you believe in love / Like I believe in pain / Nobody died for you / Somebody pray for me / When you see me cut me down / And I will force it underground / There's no one left to hurt but me / And it's because of me / Right / I want to see you suffer / Suffer / When you see me cut me down / And I will force it underground / There's no one left to hurt but me / And it's because of me / Right / When you see me cut me down / And when you see me cut me down / And when you see me cut me down / And it's because of me / Suffer / ___________________ / Name Because Of Me / Artist Seether / Album Karma & Effect"/>
