And you should know

Was there a price set before?
There's something greater there
What is my body worth?

(What we have done)
We choose our moves so carefully for you
(Carefully for you)
I will not let you go
(Let you go)

It's not gonna change you

What is my body worth?
Was there a price set before?
It's not gonna change you

Why believe in nothing
Why believe in nothing at all
