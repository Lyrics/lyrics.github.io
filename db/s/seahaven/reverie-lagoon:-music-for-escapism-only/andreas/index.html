<title>Seahaven â€“ Andreas | Lyrics</title>
<meta name="description" content="Come to me, come to me. I'll be your friend / Leave sitting alone at home with your open wrists that bleed all over / It's been notable years (apart) now, but that's easy for me / Maybe if I was not so vain, well maybe then I would have seen it / You will find yourself in time; all it will take is some time / Know that all that it will take is some time / I am furthest from the sun, closest to roots of the tree / You're not the only one under shade suffering / You'll hate her forevermore, and you'll love her the same / She'll never understand, because life seems to work that way / The dark DNA intact leaves a stain in your brain / And I am not all that you see, most of it you'd never want to be / Enigma: deplete. I'm begging / Priority: I'm learning / All that is need; I will be / Not enough time for trying / All that you are is much more / Than what you call as your worth / You're who this is for, you're foremost / Don't you forget, I love you / _____________ / Name Andreas / Artist Seahaven / Album Reverie Lagoon: Music For Escapism Only"/>
