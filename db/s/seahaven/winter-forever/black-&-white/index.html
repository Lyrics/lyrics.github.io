    <div class="view"><pre>She said, "Why is it that you cannot seem to cough up a reason
As to why you threw me into the winter to freeze?"
I said, "I cannot deliver to you a simple answer
For it's far too complex for my complex to conceive

'Cause I just let you go, to let you go
I ran away, found drugs
Just I don't think you deserve what I was
N'more importantly now, what I have become"
So now you say, you say, you say

"Don't you know that I am exactly what you wanted?
And still am what you want, and what you need
But you seem to have forgotten, the promises you promised
Where you do not forget about me"

You chase the time apart with alcohol and a fresh vibrant flame
Though I do question the value within the hue
While I'm held in the arms of a friend, nearly drank myself to death
I spill of how it's always been about you

Then that morning we made the sweetest love
I walked you outside to watch the sun
As it rose to resemble you and I
Days later, the moon shone upon your lies
So now I say, I say, I say

"Don't you know that I am exactly what you wanted?
And still am what you want, and what you need
But you seem to have forgotten, the promises you promised
Where you do not forget about me"

Hurry, hurry, hurry like I
Scurry, scurry, scurry away
Hurry, hurry, hurry before
I get carried away

Hurry, hurry, hurry like I
Scurry, scurry, scurried away
Hurry, hurry, hurry like I
Got carried away

Well, don't you know that I am exactly what you wanted?
And still am what you want, and what you need
But you seem to have forgotten, the promises you promised
Where you do not forget about me</pre></div>
