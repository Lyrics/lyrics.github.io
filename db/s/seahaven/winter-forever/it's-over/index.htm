<div><pre>Well, it rained today inside of me
Winds of dismay, they blew me away
And I felt the change in the weather
It be my blame to place, well, it's over, it's over now

Don't tell me, don't tell me this is for good
And the leaves will never change
I'm waiting, still waiting for your face
To exceed a picture frame
It's four years and a work week to regret
And blame you all over again
And the rest of my life to sleep
And dream of what it could have been

Broken is more now than broken ever was then
Something with some form of fix has gone and grown hopeless
So invent the tools to mend years, years, years of negligence
Or the ability to forget because it's over, it's all over now

Don't tell me, don't tell me this is for good
And the leaves will never change
I'm waiting, still waiting for your face
To exceed a picture frame
It's four years and a work week to regret
And blame you all over again
And the rest of my life to sleep
And dream of what it could have been

You would not believe (you would not believe)
The degree of irony (irony)
That could be in a five-letter metaphor
No, you wouldn't believe, oh no

And in a period of time (period of time)
How many consistent increments compiled (increments compiled)
That could be for news that changes your life
No, you wouldn't believe, oh no

Don't tell me, don't tell me this is for good
And the leaves will never change
I'm waiting, still waiting for your face
To exceed a picture frame
It's four years and a work week to regret
And blame you all over again
And the rest of my life to sleep
And dream of what it could have been</pre></div>
