You can be all you desire
An honest man - a vicious liar
Seek out the Light or seek the Dark

You can honor or desecrate
Sympathize or manipulate
Carved in your flesh - embrace the Mark

Enslaved and hypnotized -
Chained to artificial lives
You are the Bastards of the Machine
The Bastards of the Machine

Be a saint for those in need
Or spin them webs of lust and greed.
Yeah, you've restored my dying faith

With a Kiss of Death - a last farewell
Hand in hand, through the Gates of Hell
You'll pay the price for the choice you make

I see your demons rise -
Deep within your burning eyes
You are the Bastards of the Machine
The Bastards of the Machine

The Bastards of the Machine
The Bastards of the Machine
