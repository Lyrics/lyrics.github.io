<title>Symphony X â€“ When All Is Lost | Lyrics</title>
<meta name="description" content="I believe... Nothing ever comes to light / Chasing shadows in the night / In a starless sky / And I wonder why / I believe... We will never find a way / That darkness lights the day / We never question why, / Still I wonder: why? / I close my eyes lost in a memory / Just like a candle in the wind / What could have been, with just one kiss goodbye / You spread your wings to fly / Far away, somehow, someday you will understand / I hope you'll understand... someday / Silent pictures speak like ghosts in the machine / Haunting my reflection in the frame / Chasing down the hopeful child inside of me / Where'd it all go wrong and who's to blame / We pass the time away / With empty lives, the laughter dies / Is this all we have to show? / Is this all they'll ever know? Can they find their way? / What went wrong? Where have all the heroes gone? / Trading futures for a song we gave away / Thinking only of myself, I forged ahead / No regrets, no apologies / Bitter tears reward the life that I have led / A world of lies brings me to my knees / I took the road with every twist and every turn / The words of wisdom is the lesson never learned / Lose your fear and free your soul or / The mysteries of life you'll truly never know / You'll truly never know / Is this all we have to show? / Is this all they'll ever know? Can they find their way? / What went wrong? Where have all the heroes gone? / Trading futures for a song we gave away / Just gave away / I close my eyes, lost in that memory / Like a candle in the wind / What could have been, with just one kiss goodbye / You spread your wings to fly far away / I hope you'll understand one day / We pass the time away / With empty lives, the laughter dies / And the colors fade, fade away / Oh daylight fades away / Oh no no no! / Is this all we have to show? / Is this all they'll ever know? Can they find their way? / What went wrong? Where have all the heroes gone? / Trading futures for a song we gave away / What went wrong? / Where have all our heroes gone? / Trade our future for a song, / We gave it all away... / ______________________ / Name When All Is Lost / Artist Symphony X / Album Iconoclast"/>
