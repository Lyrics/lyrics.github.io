Screaming at the walls around me -
Broken and alone
Fighting with my inner demons is all I've ever known

All I am - I give to you
All my dreams and nightmares, too

Disconnected life of anguish -
The mirror fades to black
Feels like I'm sinking deep into illusion.
No one's staring back

Somewhere unseen - there's something between
Is it the truth or a lie...

CHORUS

Can't you see - You and me
We're Children of a Faceless God
Misery is our destiny
We're Children of a Faceless God

Just another faceless shadow - I'm desensitized
And I don't feel the pain, am I insane?
My nightmare's realized

Somewhere unseen - there's something between
Is it the truth or a lie...

REPEAT CHORUS

All I have - I give to you
All my dreams, my nightmares, too

Wretched promenade - watch the freak parade
Celebrate the suffering and affliction

Laugh at tragedy - worship sin with me
Let us share in selfish addiction

Spitting on the shrine - drink the poison wine
Leave a life in ruins - tattered and torn

Completely interfaced to a God without a Face
In his image of darkness... I'm reborn

REPEAT CHORUS
