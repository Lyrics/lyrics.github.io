    <div class="view"><div id="lyrics">Forged in blood, carved in stone
Right before your eyes, you've always known
See the truth inside yourself,
See the world like no one else
If only you were king, you could change everything

Can't you see what they're doing to you and me?

We rule - We fly
Above the lights of the neon sky
We fight - We cry
The Lords of Chaos will never die

All you see must be destroyed
Your destiny. you can't avoid
Show them all your demon sign,
Tell them all to get in line
Oh, there's no time to waste,
It's poison but they can't taste it

Don't you see what they're doing to you and me?

We rule - We fly
Above the lights of the neon sky
We fight - We cry
The Lords of Chaos will never die

The quick and the dead
Moving fast, they're in your head
Infection spreads in the blood of the damned

The truth and the lies
It's all the same - it's just a game you see
Day and night, you hold them in your hands...

Can't you see what they're doing to you and me?

We rule - We fly
Above the lights of the neon sky
We fight - We cry
The Lords of Chaos will never die

We rule - We fly
Above the lights of the neon sky
We fight - We cry
The Lords of Chaos will never ever die</div></div>
