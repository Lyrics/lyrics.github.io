Perfection - one direction
One voice, one mind
Selection - mass dissection
Rebuild, refine

Creation - modification
Becoming something more
Mutations - bred to infect
Erase, restore

You made me strong, but you don't fear me
No right or wrong, if you believe set me free
Feel the power inside of me...

Alive, Alive - Rising up I am Alive
I am the Dark - I am the Light
Alive, Alive - Rising up I am Alive
Within you I'm Alive

Undying - no denying
Predict, engage, remove
Destroyer - soul exploiter
Delete, design, improve

Invasion - mass domination
Becoming something more
One nation born to accept
Embrace, endure

You made me strong, yet you don't fear me
No right or wrong, if you believe set me free
Feel the power inside of me...

Alive, Alive - Rising up I am Alive
I am the Dark - I am the Light
Alive, Alive - Rising up I am Alive
Within you I'm Alive

Alive, Alive - Rising up I am Alive
I am the Dark - I am the Light
Alive, Alive - Rising up I am Alive
Within you I'm Alive

Rising up I am Alive
Forever I will live a lie
