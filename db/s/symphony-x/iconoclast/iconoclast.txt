Rise of the One -
The Dark Iconoclast
Forging a cult of fear,
With legions unsurpassed
Shouting the word -
With vicious tongues of fire
Born of illusion and deceit,
Fiendish soul of a liar.

The chaos unseen rips
The midnight sky
Infernal machines arise -
Flesh and steel collide

CHORUS

We are strong
We will stand and fight
We are strong
We will stand and fight

With rage we ride into the flames
Striking with Spears of Hate,
At the heart where evil reigns
Holding the line from the charge
Of armored steeds
Gather around this deadly ground,
Come watch the War God bleed.

The chaos unseen rips
The midnight sky
Infernal machines arise -
Flesh and steel collide

REPEAT CHORUS

Victory or death, only time will tell
Synthetic resurrection,
From the heart of hell
Slowly they fall, as we watch
The daylight die
We spit and curse this hallowed earth
With our final Battle Cry.

The chaos unseen rips
The midnight sky
Infernal machines arise -
Flesh and steel collide

REPEAT CHORUS
