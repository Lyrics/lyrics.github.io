You're nothing
You're nobody
You're a stupid dream
Well
All dreams come to an end
30 seconds you'll be dead
I'll blow this place up and be home in time for cornflakes

Who gives a shit what you believe

You're a stupid dream
Well
All dreams come to an end

You're nothing

You're a stupid dream

Well

All dreams come to an end
30 seconds you'll be dead
I'll blow this place up and be home in time for cornflakes

Gives a shit what you believe

30 seconds you'll be dead
You're a stupid dream
Well
All dreams come to an end
