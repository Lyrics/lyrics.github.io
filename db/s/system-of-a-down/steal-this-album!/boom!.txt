I've been walking through your streets
Where all your money's earned
Where all your buildings crying
And clueless neckties working
Revolving fake lawn houses
Housing all your fears
Desensitized by TV

Overbearing advertising
God of consumerism
And all your crooked pictures looking good
Mirrorism
Filtering information for the public eye
Designed for profiteering
Your neighbor, what a guy

Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom!
Every time you drop the bomb
You kill the god your child has borne
Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom!

Modern globalization
Coupled with condemnations
Unnecessary death
Matador corporations
Puppeting your frustrations
With a blinded flag

Manufacturing consent
Is the name of the game
The bottom line is money
Nobody gives a fuck!
Four thousand hungry children leave us per hour from starvation
While billions are spent on bombs
Creating death showers

Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom!
Every time you drop the bomb
You kill the god your child has borne
Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom!

Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom!

Why must we kill our own kind?

Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom!
Every time you drop the bomb
You kill the god your child has born
Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom!
Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom!

Every time you drop the boom!
