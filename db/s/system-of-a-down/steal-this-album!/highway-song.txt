I need, I feel, a love,
You love to love the fear,
I never want to be alone,
I've forgotten to, The road keeps moving clouds,
The clouds become unreal,
I guess I'll always be at home,
Do you want me to try,
Directing your night,

An exit lights the sky,
The sky becomes complete,
Traveling hearts divide the throne,
I've forgotten to,

Friction, lines, bumps,
The highway song complete,
The signs are all turning right,
Do you want me to try,
Directing your night,
Want me to try,
Directing your light,

The purest forms of life,
Our days are never coming back,
The cannons of our time,
Our days are never coming back,
The purest forms of life,
Our days are never coming back,
The cannons of our time,
Our days are never ever coming back.

Our days are never coming back,
Our days are never coming back,
Our days are never coming back.
