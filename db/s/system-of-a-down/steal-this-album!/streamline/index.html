    <div class="view"><div id="lyrics">I wasn't there for you
I wasn't there for you

I know weather's gonna be fine
But I can't see you 'cross the streamline
My love waits for me in daytime
But I can't see you through the snow blind

But I wasn't there for you
You are gone (I wasn't there for you)
Goodbyes are long
Goodbye (I wasn't there for you)
Goodbye
I wasn't there for goodbye
I wasn't there for goodbye

Well, I've known time reveals in hindsight
I can wrestle with the stormy night
Because your love lasts a lifetime
But I can see you through the snow blind

But I wasn't there for you
You are gone (but I wasn't there for you)
Goodbyes are long
You are gone (I wasn't there for you)
Goodbyes are long (I wasn't there for you)
Goodbye

I wasn't there for you
I wasn't there
I wasn't there for you
I wasn't there for you

You are gone (I wasn't there for you)
Goodbyes are long
Goodbye
Goodbye
Goodbye</div></div>
