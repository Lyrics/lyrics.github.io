Well I have a home, longing to roam
I have to find you, I have to meet you
Signs of your face, slowing your pace
I need your guidance, I need to seek my

Innervision, innervision

My pupils dance, lost in a trance
Your sacred silence, losing all violence
Stars in their place, mirror your face
I need to find you, I need to seek my

Innervision, innervision, innervision

It's never too late to reinvent the bicycle
A smile brings forth energy or life
Giving you force

It's never too late to reinvent the bicycle
A smile brings forth energy or life
Giving you force

Vision

There's only one true path in life
The road that leads to all leads to one
(Innervision) There's only one true path in life
(Innervision) The road that leads to all
Innervision

Your sacred silence, losing all violence
