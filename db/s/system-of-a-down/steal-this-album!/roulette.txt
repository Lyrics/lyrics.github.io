I have a problem that I can not explain
I have no reason why it should've been so plain
I have no questions but I sure have excuse
I lack the reasons why I should be so confused

I know how I feel when I'm around you
I don't know how I feel when I'm around you
Around you

Left a message, but it ain't a bit of use
I have some pictures, the wild might be the deuce
Today you saw, you saw me, you explained
Playing the show and running down the plane

I know how I feel when I'm around you
I don't know how I feel when I'm around you
I, I know how I feel when I'm around you
I, don't know how I feel when I'm around you
Around you

I, I know how I feel when I'm around you
I, don't know how I feel when I'm around you
I, I know how I feel when I'm around you
I, don't know how I feel when I'm around you...

Around you
Around you
Around you
Around you...
