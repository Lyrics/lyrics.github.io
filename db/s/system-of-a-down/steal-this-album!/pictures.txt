Flaunt your will at every wheel,
Parachute your chocolate soul,
Cobblestones under your wheels,
I got pictures on my mind,
I got pictures on my mind,
I got pictures on my mind,
I got pictures on my mind.

Circumvent your thick ego,
Wooden farts, they're on the go,
You can't tell me that I'm real,
I got pictures on my mind,
I got pictures on my mind,
I got pictures on my mind,
I got pictures on my mind.

Fear waits, for us,
When the present can't be sealed,
Away, gold dust,
Now the dishes can be cleared.

Fear waits, for us,
Till the moment is revealed,
Then turns to rust
For the mighty conquered meal.

Can't you look at my shaved ass,
Ounce is gone, and God is once,
You can't see me suddenly,
I got pictures on my mind,
I got pictures on my mind,
I got pictures on my mind,
I got pictures on my mind.

I got pictures on my mind.
