<div><pre>And the little boy stared
Into the eyes of the night
Button collects price of his time
Little girl glared
Sheets of denial
Bullet connects to the price of her crime

What have we said
Wasn't it their bed
What of presence
Haven't we paid penance
To the new guns

Now the little boy sees
Through the eyes of delight
Levers erect note of his rhyme
Little girl bled
Sheets of the night
Lovers connect to the price of his dime

What have we said
Wasn't it their bed
What of presence
Haven't we paid penance
To the new guns, to the new guns

What have we said
Wasn't it their bed
What of presence
Haven't we paid penance
What have we said
Wasn't it their bed
What of presence
Haven't we paid penance
To the new guns, to the new guns

(Background:
To the old gods and moved on
To the old gods and moved on
To the old gods and moved on)

To you!

SONG MEANING: It's an allegorical reference to wider political corruption etc, implying the government sells the American military and funds etc to the highest bidder, and equally violates those it's able to exploit. America is referred to the "she" in the song.</pre></div>
