Sweet berries ready for two
Ghosts are no different than you
Ghosts are now waiting for you
Are you
Sweet berries ready for two
Ghosts are no different than you
Ghosts are now waiting for you
Are you dreaming

Dreaming the night
Dreaming all right

Do we, do we know
When we fly
When we, when we go
Do we die

Sweet berries ready for two
Ghosts are no different than you
Ghosts are now waiting for you
Are you
Sweet berries ready for two
Ghosts are no different than you
Ghosts are now waiting for you
Are you dreaming?

Dreaming the night
Dreaming all right

Do we, do we know
When we fly
When we, when we go
Do we die

Do we, do we know
When we fly
When we, when we go
Do we die
