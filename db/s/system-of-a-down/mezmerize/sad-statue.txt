Conquest to the lover
And your love to the fire
Permanence unfolding in the absolute
Forgiveness is the ultimate sacrifice
Eloquence belongs to the conqueror

The pictures of time and space are rearranged
In this little piece of typical tragedy
Justified candy
Brandy for the nerves
Eloquence belongs to the conqueror

You and me
We'll all go down in history
With a sad Statue of Liberty
And a generation that didn't agree
You and me
We'll all go down in history
With a sad Statue of Liberty
And a generation that didn't agree

I forgot to
I forgot to let you know that

Justified candy
Brandy for the nerves
Eloquence belongs to the conqueror

Conquest to the lover
And your love to the fire
Permanence unfolding in the absolute
Forgiveness is the ultimate sacrifice
Eloquence belongs to the conqueror

You and me
We'll all go down in history
With a sad Statue of Liberty
And a generation that didn't agree
You and me
We'll all go down in history
With a sad Statue of Liberty
And a generation that didn't agree
Generation

What is in us that turns a deaf ear to the cries of human suffering
Suffering, suffering now

You and me
We'll all go down in history
With a sad Statue of Liberty
And a generation that didn't agree
You and me
We'll all go down in history
With a sad Statue of Liberty
And a generation that didn't agree
Generation
