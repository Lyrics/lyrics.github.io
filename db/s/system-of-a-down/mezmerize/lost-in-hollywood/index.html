<title>System of a Down â€“ Lost In Hollywood | Lyrics</title>
<meta name="description" content="I'll wait here / You're crazy / Those vicious streets are filled with strays / You should've never gone to Hollywood / They find you / Two-time you / Say you're the best they've ever seen / You should've never trusted Hollywood / I wrote you / And told you / You were the biggest fish out here / You should've never gone to Hollywood / They take you / And make you / They look at you in disgusting ways / You should've never trusted Hollywood / I was standing on the wall / Feeling ten feet tall / All you maggots / Smoking fags on Santa Monica Boulevard / This is my front page / This is my new age / All you bitches put your hands in the air / And wave them like you just don't care / All you maggots / Smoking fags out there on Sunset Boulevard / All you bitches put your hands in the air / And wave them like you just don't care / Phony people come to pray / Look at all of them beg to stay / Phony people come to pray / (The lines in the letter said / "We have gone to Hackensack") / Look at all of them beg to stay / Phony people come to pray / All you maggots / Smoking fags on Santa Monica Boulevard / All you maggots / Smoking fags out there on Sunset Boulevard / All you maggots / Smoking fags out there on Hollywood Boulevard / You should've never trusted Hollywood / You should've never gone to Hollywood / All you bitches put your hands in the air / And wave them like you just don't care / You should've never trusted Hollywood / _______________________ / Name Lost In Hollywood / Artist System of a Down / Album Mezmerize"/>
