<div><pre>I'll wait here
You're crazy
Those vicious streets are filled with strays
You should've never gone to Hollywood

They find you
Two-time you
Say you're the best they've ever seen
You should've never trusted Hollywood

I wrote you
And told you
You were the biggest fish out here
You should've never gone to Hollywood

They take you
And make you
They look at you in disgusting ways
You should've never trusted Hollywood

I was standing on the wall
Feeling ten feet tall
All you maggots
Smoking fags on Santa Monica Boulevard

This is my front page
This is my new age
All you bitches put your hands in the air
And wave them like you just don't care

All you maggots
Smoking fags out there on Sunset Boulevard
All you bitches put your hands in the air
And wave them like you just don't care

Phony people come to pray
Look at all of them beg to stay
Phony people come to pray

(The lines in the letter said
"We have gone to Hackensack")

Look at all of them beg to stay
Phony people come to pray

All you maggots
Smoking fags on Santa Monica Boulevard

All you maggots
Smoking fags out there on Sunset Boulevard

All you maggots
Smoking fags out there on Hollywood Boulevard

You should've never trusted Hollywood
You should've never gone to Hollywood

All you bitches put your hands in the air
And wave them like you just don't care

You should've never trusted Hollywood</pre></div>
