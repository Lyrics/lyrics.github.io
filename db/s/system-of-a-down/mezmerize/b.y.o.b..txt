You

Why do they always send the poor?

Barbarisms by Barbaras, with pointed heels
Victorious victories kneel, for brand new spankin' deals
Marching forward hypocritic and hypnotic computers
You depend on our protection, yet you feed us lies from the tablecloth

La-la-la-la la-la-la-la-la, ooh

Everybody's going to the party have a real good time
Dancing in the desert, blowin' up the sunshine

Kneeling roses disappearing into Moses's dry mouth
Breaking into Fort Knox stealing our intentions
Hangers sitting dripped in oil, crying freedom
Handed to obsoletion, still you feed us lies from the tablecloth

La-la-la-la la-la-la-la-la, ooh

Everybody's going to the party, have a real good time
Dancing in the desert, blowing up the sunshine

Well everybody's going to the party have a real good time
Dancing in the desert, blowin' up the sunshine

Blast off, it's party time
And we don't live in a fascist nation
Blast off, it's party time
And where the fuck are you?

Where the fuck are you?
Where the fuck are you?

Why don't presidents fight the war?
Why do they always send the poor?
Why don't presidents fight the war?
Why do they always send the poor?
Why do they always send the poor?
Why do they always send the poor?
Why do they always send the poor?

Kneeling roses disappearing into Moses's dry mouth
Breaking into Fort Knox stealing our intentions
Hangars sitting dripped in oil, crying freedom
Handed to obsoletion, still you feed us lies from the tablecloth

La-la-la-la la-la-la-la-la, ooh

Everybody's going to the party have a real good time
Dancing in the desert, blowin' up the sunshine

Well everybody's going to the party have a real good time
Dancing in the desert, blowin' up the sun-

Where the fuck are you?
Where the fuck are you?

Why don't presidents fight the war?
Why do they always send the poor?
Why don't presidents fight the war?
Why do they always send the poor?
Why do they always send the poor?
Why do they always send the poor?

Why, do, they always send the poor?
Why, do, they always send the poor?
Why, do, they always send the poor?
They always send the poor
They always send the poor
