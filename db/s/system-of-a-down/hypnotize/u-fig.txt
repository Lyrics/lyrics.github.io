Melt in the sun, melt in the sun
Who wants to come with me and melt in the sun?
Hide in the sky, hide in the sky
Who wants to come with me and hide in the sky?

You and me should go outside and
Beat 'em, beat 'em, beat 'em, beat 'em, beat 'em, beat 'em
All pathetic flag waving ignorant geeks and we'll
Eat 'em, eat 'em, eat 'em, eat 'em, eat 'em, eat 'em

Come join the cause, come join the cause
Who wants to come with me and come join the cause?
Hide in the sky, hide in the sky
Who wants to come with me and hide in the sky?

You and me should go outside and
Beat 'em, beat 'em, beat 'em, beat 'em, beat 'em, beat 'em
All pathetic flag waving ignorant geeks and we'll
Eat 'em, eat 'em, eat 'em, eat 'em, eat 'em, eat 'em

You and me should go outside and
Beat 'em, beat 'em, beat 'em, beat 'em, beat 'em, beat 'em
All pathetic flag waving ignorant geeks and we'll
Eat 'em, eat 'em, eat 'em, eat 'em, eat 'em, eat 'em

Realize you're blind
And we're out of time
It'll show your mind

Melt in the sun, melt in the sun
Who wants to come with me and melt in the sun?
Hide in the sky, hide in the sky
Who wants to come with me and hide in the sky?

You and me should go outside and
Beat 'em, beat 'em, beat 'em, beat 'em, beat 'em, beat 'em
All pathetic flag waving ignorant hicks and we'll
Eat 'em, eat 'em, eat 'em, eat 'em, eat 'em, eat 'em

You and me should go outside and
Beat 'em, beat 'em, beat 'em, beat 'em, beat 'em, beat 'em
All pathetic flag waving ignorant hicks and we'll
Eat 'em, eat 'em, eat 'em, eat 'em, eat 'em, eat 'em

Eat 'em, eat 'em, eat 'em, eat 'em, eat 'em, eat 'em
Eat 'em, eat 'em, eat 'em, eat 'em, eat 'em, eat 'em
Eat 'em, eat 'em, eat 'em, eat 'em, eat 'em, eat 'em

It'll show your mind that you have a mind
