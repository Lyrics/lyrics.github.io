Breathing each other's lives
Holding this in mind
That if we fall, we all fall
And we fall alone

The cold insincerity of steel machines
Have consumed our euphoria
Transforming us into muted dreams
Dreaming of the day that

We attack
Attack, attack your fetal servitude
We attack
Attack, attack, attack with pesticide
We attack
All the years of propaganda
We shall attack

Books illustrate what we already know
Candles cry towards the sky
Racing your flags along polluted coast
Dreaming of the day that

We attack
Attack, attack your fetal servitude
We attack
Attack, attack, attack with pesticide
We attack
All the years of propaganda
We shall attack

Attack!
(Attack!)

Breathing each other's lives
Holding this in mind
That if we fall, we all fall
And we fall alone

Breathing each other's lives
Holding this in mind
That if we fall, we all fall
And we fall alone

What's the philosophy of displaced minds
The bombing of all homes and villages?
Truth is the only sword bleeding minds
Bleeding till the day that

We attack
Attack, attack your fetal servitude
We attack
Attack, attack, attack with pesticide
We attack
All the years of propaganda
We shall attack!

Attack all the homes and villages
Attack all the schools and hospitals
You attack all the rapes and pillages
We shall attack!

We shall attack!
