<div><pre>For today, we will take the body parts
And put them on the wall
For treated indigenously, digenously
Human right is private blue chip, pry

We're the prophetic generation of bottled water, bottled water
Causing poor populations to die, to die, to die
(For treated indigenously, digenously)
(Human right is private blue chip, pry)

You, you went beyond and you lost it all
Why did you go there?
From beyond you saw it all
Why did you?

We lost consumer confidence in casual karma, casual karma
Confetti, camouflage, camouflage, the flage, the flage
(For treated indigenously, digenously)
(Human right is private blue chip, pry)

We're the prophetic generation of bottled water, bottled water
Causing poor populations to die, to die, to die
(For treated indigenously, digenously)
(Human right is private blue chip, pry)

You, you went beyond and you lost it all
Why did you go there?
From beyond you saw it all
Why did you go there?

She lost her mind
Someone kicked her into the back of the line
She lost her head
When they called and they said that they thought he was dead

Dreaming of screaming
Someone kick me out of my mind
I hate these thoughts, I can't deny
Dreaming of screaming
Someone kick me out of my mind
I hate these thoughts I can't de-

We lost consumer confidence in casual karma, casual karma
Confetti, camouflage, camouflage, the flage, the flage
(For treated indigenously, digenously)
(Human right is private blue chip, pry)

We're the prophetic generation of bottled water, bottled water
Causing poor populations to die, to die, to die
(For treated indigenously, digenously)
(Human right is private blue chip, pry)

You, you went beyond and you lost it all
Why did you go there?
From beyond you saw it all
Why did you

Dreaming of screaming
Someone kick me out of my mind
I hate these thoughts I can't deny
Dreaming of screaming
Someone kick me out of my mind
I hate these thoughts I can't deny

You will take the body parts and put them up on the wall
And bring the dark disaster

SONG MEANING: It's about how people are self serving and how they don't see the bigger picture of the less fortunate.</pre></div>
