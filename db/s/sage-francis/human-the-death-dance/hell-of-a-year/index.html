<meta name="description" content="It's been a hell of a year, but I'm mentally prepared / To do a dance around the next couple medical scares / I'm Fred Astaire with the metal wearing quickly off my tap shoes / So I step quietly, the way that cat's move"/>

    <div class="view"><article id="lyrics"><p>It's been a hell of a year, but I'm mentally prepared<br/>To do a dance around the next couple medical scares<br/>I'm Fred Astaire with the metal wearing quickly off my tap shoes<br/>So I step quietly, the way that cat's move<br/>But I'm bear-like. My head trapped in dear lights<br/>You can call me John, I'm writing letters to the dark side of the moon tonight<br/>My lovely Jane, you went away but the pain stayed<br/>So I'm sending you a package to the address where you traded names<br/>I made no claims on the identity theft<br/>I'm more concerned about the home with no amenities left<br/>And it's already a mess. The dust piles like your junk mail<br/>So I eat away depression and crush the scale<br/>You find yourself on the opposite side of the spectrum<br/>Emaciated on a strict diet of bed crumbs<br/>Me? I choose to wallow and I'll just swim in my fat<br/>You...refuse to swallow so I see ribs from the back<br/>This isn't an attack, it's an admission of guilt<br/>I'm living in the past, kissing your ass, sipping your milk<br/>But it's all bone and curdle. I saw stones in a circle<br/>Stood in the middle. Told myself riddles in a robe that's purple<br/>The murder weapon was an icicle<br/>Is that the reason why I'm standing in this puddle with my eyes so full?<br/>I fight feelings like a war on drugs<br/>I'm a chemist with a test tube addiction born through coffee mugs<br/>Our baby now is all growed up<br/>Your car is still dead in my driveway while I wait for the tow truck<br/>And you know what? I know I drove you away<br/>I still don't think it was wrong so I don't know what to say<br/>It's been a tough year. You say that life ain't fair<br/>Well, guess what, baby...life ain't. Thems the breaks<br/>You say that life ain't worth it. But it is. You gotta work it<br/>Nobody's life is perfect</p><p>Yeah, you've been dealt a bad hand. Placed against a stacked deck<br/>Been through all the cat scans and bad checks<br/>But I slashed your debt. Not your wrists<br/>And I couldn't help with anything else that became cancerous<br/>Halfway people with a full baby to bury<br/>Took a flame to the papier-mache sanctuary<br/>When the smoke clears...try not to stare into the light<br/>But, also, don't stay in the dark as if that's what life is like<br/>It's just a series of unfortunate events<br/>But the messages we get are more important than death<br/>What's the rush?<br/>I've got a shortness of breath<br/>What's the rush?<br/>Running from you...running from me<br/>It's the rush. The crush. The lust. The love-trust<br/>So what's the trouble? The busted bubble? The unjust?<br/>That's just the way the cookie crumbles. It does suck<br/>But suck it up. We're all looking, but nothing's enough<br/>We used each other as a crutch. The clutch. The shift switches<br/>You couldn't just adjust. You combusted and ripped pictures<br/>This is why I'm not considered a saint?<br/>Well, guess what? ... I ain't</p><p>It's been a hell of a year<br/>You said that I ain't there, I ain't care, and life ain't fair<br/>It's been a hell of a trip<br/>You say my mind's unfit, I've been flip, and I ain't shit<br/>It's been a hell of a life<br/>You say that I ain't like the way I write and that ain't right<br/>It's been a hell of an attempt<br/>You say that I ain't meant for promises unkept<br/>Well, guess what, darlin..<br/>I'm a keep keep callin<br/>Guess what, darlin..<br/>I'm a keep keep callin</p></article></div>
