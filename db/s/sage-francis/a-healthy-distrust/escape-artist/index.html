through the pain and remain conscience<span><br/></span>Refraining from commenting on the lame compliments<span><br/></span>And the petty criticisms from those who ain't accomplished<span><br/></span>Even one fifths of some of this shit I made progress with<span><br/></span>I'm leaving naysayers stumped like rain forests<span><br/></span>After years of pullin' rabit

filling my running assignment<span><br/></span>I'm just wondering where my time went, it pulled a disappearing act<span><br/></span>and every single assistant I ever had got sawed in half<span><br/></span><span class="g"><br/></span>You See I never payed attention<span><br/></span>But I can't afford to laugh<span><br/></span>'cause I'm lookin' for my break in an autograph for my

folks gave me this already broken heart as my pallet<span><br/></span>While I was out honing my craft you was disowning your talent<span><br/></span>That's why you still live at
