    <div class="view"><article id="lyrics"><p>(When I first got in to magic, yeah.)</p><p>When I first got into magic, it was an underground phenomenon<br/>Now everybody's like pick a card, any card<br/>If I shot my full load with the first hand I played<br/>I'd be a monkey in a box hangin' with the David Blaines<br/>I be swimmin' with the sharks, mouths full of razor blades<br/>But I'm not, I got out of that game</p><p>Escape Artist</p><p>I talk 'til I'm red in my face with strain polyps<br/>I'll rock 'til I'm out of my range then raise octaves<br/>I play through the pain and remain conscience<br/>Refraining from commenting on the lame compliments<br/>And the petty criticisms from those who ain't accomplished<br/>Even one fifths of some of this shit I made progress with<br/>I'm leaving naysayers stumped like rain forests<br/>After years of pullin' rabit ears out my pants pockets<br/>I'm not revealin' any tricks of the trade<br/>It's just there ain't no magic in the breakdown baby</p><p>In an effort to make 'em all see what I found in my life I decided to give 'em a look<br/>none of 'em gave it a glimpse and I guess that I'm sitting in the middle of an unread book<br/>letters are falling apart<br/>but the sentences descend on their own and the wording is permanent<br/>never been missed<br/>I've just been mis-<br/>worded and mis-<br/>interpreted, it's<br/>funny how serving a sentence of solitary confinement<br/>results in the death sentences filling my running assignment<br/>I'm just wondering where my time went, it pulled a disappearing act<br/>and every single assistant I ever had got sawed in half</p><p>You See I never payed attention<br/>But I can't afford to laugh<br/>'cause I'm lookin' for my break in an autograph for my CAST<br/>but I'm short on staff so all I ask is volunteers in the crowd<br/>show a little bit of audience participation now</p><p>When I say hip (what do I say?)<br/>You, you say shut the fuck up we ain't sayin shit!<br/>And I'll respect it<br/>Check it,<br/>In a flair for the dramatic exit<br/>A fashionable entrance<br/>Late to my own arraignment (Oh!)<br/>The self-destructive things that I do for entertainment<br/>My folks gave me this already broken heart as my pallet<br/>While I was out honing my craft you was disowning your talent<br/>That's why you still live at home<br/>And I bought this house off my parents<br/>I'm getting ahead of myself<br/>(gettin ahead of myself)<br/>I see the hair on my back<br/>(see the hair on my back)<br/>I'm on the road reading Kerouac<br/>It's poems versus better raps<br/>I think to myself<br/>What's worth remembering<br/>Versus defending the size of my manhood or confessional canned goods</p><p>In an effort to make 'em all see what I found in my life I decided to give 'em a look<br/>none of 'em gave it a glimpse and I guess that I'm sitting in the middle of an unread book<br/>letters are falling apart<br/>but the sentences descend on their own and the wording is permanent<br/>never been missed<br/>I've just been mis-<br/>worded and mis-<br/>interpreted, it's<br/>funny how serving a sentence of solitary confinement<br/>results in the death sentences filling my running assignment<br/>but none of this is getting told in confidence<br/>I spin confidential records just to hold the listeners attention</p><p>I'm a veteran of spacial relationships<br/>I clip ya wings to fit you in head shrinking magician<br/>Shape-shifting reptilian turned body contortionist<br/>Orphanages started offering torches to abortion clinics<br/>I lost acquaintances<br/>And a morgue of lady friends<br/>I gender bent the heaven sent angelic devil boy with God's androgynous<br/>I'm lookin' marvelous but looks can kill<br/>And I'm unsure about my sexual orientations still<br/>Put me in a special kind of case that only breaks if<br/>You hit it with a bouquet of flowers and baby breath arrangement<br/>The vault is vacant<br/>They're all looking for fault or blame<br/>I called my agent<br/>The moment that I caught the train<br/>I let him know, I'm going nowhere, he's invited<br/>If he leaves tonight then he just might help me find it<br/>But this is my burden to bare, not his<br/>And I'm a psychic without a sidekick<br/>Holding the future hostage<br/>A loose cannon standing on the roof top with<br/>A new respect and understanding of bartenders and locksmiths<br/>They call me daredevil but I'm not precise enough<br/>Unprofessional on an amateur level, I love my life too much</p><p>Escape Artist<br/>Escape Artist<br/>Escape Artist<br/>Escape Artist<br/>Escape Artist</p><p>I'm in two places at once</p><p>Escape Artist</p><p>I ain't slept in months</p><p>Escape Artist</p><p>I'm just trying to get away<br/>Ain't no magic in the breakdown baby</p><p>(Ain't no magic in the breakdown baby<br/>No magic in the break<br/>Ain't no magic in the breakdown ba-by</p><p>Escape Artist)</p><p>(Pussies, you're scared to shoot me in the heart!<br/>You know it's too big, uhh!<br/>Fuck, I gotta bulletproof heart, hit me baby.<br/>I'll never fall in love with you, ever!<br/>If you got (heart?) so I do! Bitch!)</p><p>Make some noise for Sage Francis ya'll!</p></article></div>
