<br/><span></span>Never knew shit, never out, never do shit, damn
<br/><span></span>But a nigga never gave two shits, damn
<br/><span></span>Never been a bitch, never had a Rollie on the wrist
<br/><span></span>Never had shit, I'ma take
<br/><span></span>Never asking, "Give me this, give me that shit
<br/><span></span>Give me everything, nigga, give me everything, nigga…"
<br/><span></span>Again, never been shit, never had shit
<br/><span></span>Never knew shit, never out, never do shit, damn
<br/><span></span>But a nigga never gave two shits, damn, damn
<br/><span></span>Never been a bitch, never had a bezel on the wrist
<br/><span></span>Never had shit, never take
<br/><span></span>Never asking, "Give me this, give me that shit
<br/><span></span>Give me everything, nigga, give me everything, nigga
<br/><span></span>Give me everything…"<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>Never had a real dollar to my name, bruh, shit been lame, bruh
<br/><span></span>I ain't even in this shit for the fame, bruh, it's the pain, bruh
<br/><span></span>Most of the niggas I came up with, haven't came up
<br/><span></span>And doin' the same stuff, but I haven't came up, this really ain't none
<br/><span></span>Niggas thinking that they fucking with JID, y'all got the game fucked up
<br/><span></span>Tremendously, can't fuck with the mind of a mental fiend
<br/><span></span>Who dig deep in the depths when he in too deep
<br/><span></span>I crept on the steps where the demon sleeps
<br/><span></span>And yell, belch, tell my Lord what he means to me
<br/><span></span>"Oh, my God, don't be mean to me"
<br/><span></span>In the ride with a bean or three
<br/><span></span>And it's not what it seems to be, I can die, I can fly
<br/><span></span>I can try very easily, I'm a guy and a giant
<br/><span></span>She's a vivrant thing, I prolly won't buy it
<br/><span></span>Bird bitch take flight, no pilot
<br/><span></span>Serve dick, curve bitch, no bias
<br/><span></span>Back up, back up, chick, bad timing
<br/><span></span>I got to get on stage, you better get on page
<br/><span></span>I have you looking out the windowpane
<br/><span></span>Or in the rain or anything but in the way
<br/><span></span>And if I say that's what it is, forget the lip
<br/><span></span>Now, what's my point, now I forget—damn, this bitch
<br/><span></span>Got me fuckin' up my script, fuck this shit, I got this shit
<br/><span></span>Gettin' to the point where everybody say they from the block and shit
<br/><span></span>With Glocks and shit and poppin', pimpin', trappin', sippin' lean
<br/><span></span>Y'all niggas fall for anything, you got the plug in Medellín?
<br/><span></span>Kingpin? You a pen king (Kingpin? You a pen king)
<br/><span></span>Bye, bye, niggas, 'N Sync, try I? Nigga, risky
<br/><span></span>Fire, fire from the wrist piece, niggas shootin' like the '60s<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>Again, never been shit, never had shit, never knew shit
<br/><span></span>Never out, never do shit, damn
<br/><span></span>But a nigga never gave two shits, damn, damn
<br/><span></span>Never been a bitch, never had a Rollie on the wrist
<br/><span></span>Never had shit, I'ma take
<br/><span></span>Never asking, "Give me this, give me that shit
<br/><span></span>Give me everything, nigga, fuck you…"<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>Uhh, let's go<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>Yeah… yeah, yeah, what, um
<br/><span></span>Alright, what you call a chick that don't suck dick? You don't
<br/><span></span>And if you think you finna come up this, you won't
<br/><span></span>Down comes the boogie and up jumps the funk
<br/><span></span>This beat takin' a beating, I hand out the lumps
<br/><span></span>Damn, baby, yo' ass stand out in pumps
<br/><span></span>That's outstanding, stand outside until your man come
<br/><span></span>Or you can leave with the kid, we can plan something
<br/><span></span>You know I came from the dirt like a sandstorm
<br/><span></span>Nigga, this a 3 point and-1
<br/><span></span>And 100, Wilt Chamberlain with the hand dunk
<br/><span></span>Shawty love JID, let me turn her to a hand puppet
<br/><span></span>She moan, sound like German or something
<br/><span></span>Run game, bitches think I'm Todd Gurley or something
<br/><span></span>Give me a jersey, I done balled so hard, I caught a hernia
<br/><span></span>Wheeled yo' bitch out my bed in a gurney
<br/><span></span>You gotta leave lil' mama, the clock's turning
<br/><span></span>I hit it first, Ray J or Ron Jeremy
<br/><span></span>They bleed like us so them niggas could never scare me
<br/><span></span>No niggas got more glow than JID, barely scratchin' the fucking surface
<br/><span></span>You need work, you need purpose
<br/><span></span>Everybody good, everybody trap perfect
<br/><span></span>Everything cool, don't nobody act nervous
<br/><span></span>Just ignore the fact that your favorite rap nigga is a sap nigga
<br/><span></span>We don't dap niggas, get the rrrat from the ratchet
<br/><span></span>Get the pack out the package
<br/><span></span>Lil' savage ass, ratchet ass, bastard ass, havin' ass
<br/><span></span>Rappin' ass, jackin' ass, wait
<br/><span></span>Finna blast, green dot, send the cash, pen and pad
<br/><span></span>Minivan, been a dad, been with that bullshit, nigga
<br/><span></span>I don't wake up to the bull like I usually do
<br/><span></span>Young niggas down the block on the woopty woop
<br/><span></span>Better pray to God they don't shoot at you
<br/><span></span>Dreams of cleanin' this dirty money out my cuticles
<br/><span></span>Then a nigga make the crowd jump like Zoboomafoo<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>Shit's beautiful, shit's beautiful
<br/><span></span>Shit's beautiful, shit's beautiful, shit's beautiful<br/><span></span><br/><span></span><br/></div><hr/><table><tbody><tr><td>Song name&nbsp;</td><td>NEVER</td><tr><td>Artist&nbsp;</td><td>JID</td><tr><td>Album&nbsp;</td><td>The Never Story</td></tbody></table></div></div><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/></div><script>var input=document.createElement("input");input.name="q";input.type="search";input.placeholder="Search";document.getElementsByTagName("nav")[0].appendChild(input)</script>
