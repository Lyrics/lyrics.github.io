<title>JID – NEVER | Lyrics</title>
<meta name="description" content="Okay, never been shit, never had shit / Never knew shit, never out, never do shit, damn / But a nigga never gave two shits, damn / Never been a bitch, never had a Rollie on the wrist / Never had shit, I'ma take / Never asking, "Give me this, give me that shit / Give me everything, nigga, give me everything, nigga…" / Again, never been shit, never had shit / Never knew shit, never out, never do shit, damn / But a nigga never gave two shits, damn, damn / Never been a bitch, never had a bezel on the wrist / Never had shit, never take / Never asking, "Give me this, give me that shit / Give me everything, nigga, give me everything, nigga / Give me everything…" / Never had a real dollar to my name, bruh, shit been lame, bruh / I ain't even in this shit for the fame, bruh, it's the pain, bruh / Most of the niggas I came up with, haven't came up / And doin' the same stuff, but I haven't came up, this really ain't none / Niggas thinking that they fucking with JID, y'all got the game fucked up / Tremendously, can't fuck with the mind of a mental fiend / Who dig deep in the depths when he in too deep / I crept on the steps where the demon sleeps / And yell, belch, tell my Lord what he means to me / "Oh, my God, don't be mean to me" / In the ride with a bean or three / And it's not what it seems to be, I can die, I can fly / I can try very easily, I'm a guy and a giant / She's a vivrant thing, I prolly won't buy it / Bird bitch take flight, no pilot / Serve dick, curve bitch, no bias / Back up, back up, chick, bad timing / I got to get on stage, you better get on page / I have you looking out the windowpane / Or in the rain or anything but in the way / And if I say that's what it is, forget the lip / Now, what's my point, now I forget—damn, this bitch / Got me fuckin' up my script, fuck this shit, I got this shit / Gettin' to the point where everybody say they from the block and shit / With Glocks and shit and poppin', pimpin', trappin', sippin' lean / Y'all niggas fall for anything, you got the plug in Medellín? / Kingpin? You a pen king (Kingpin? You a pen king) / Bye, bye, niggas, 'N Sync, try I? Nigga, risky / Fire, fire from the wrist piece, niggas shootin' like the '60s / Again, never been shit, never had shit, never knew shit / Never out, never do shit, damn / But a nigga never gave two shits, damn, damn / Never been a bitch, never had a Rollie on the wrist / Never had shit, I'ma take / Never asking, "Give me this, give me that shit / Give me everything, nigga, fuck you…" / Uhh, let's go / Yeah… yeah, yeah, what, um / Alright, what you call a chick that don't suck dick? You don't / And if you think you finna come up this, you won't / Down comes the boogie and up jumps the funk / This beat takin' a beating, I hand out the lumps / Damn, baby, yo' ass stand out in pumps / That's outstanding, stand outside until your man come / Or you can leave with the kid, we can plan something / You know I came from the dirt like a sandstorm / Nigga, this a 3 point and-1 / And 100, Wilt Chamberlain with the hand dunk / Shawty love JID, let me turn her to a hand puppet / She moan, sound like German or something / Run game, bitches think I'm Todd Gurley or something / Give me a jersey, I done balled so hard, I caught a hernia / Wheeled yo' bitch out my bed in a gurney / You gotta leave lil' mama, the clock's turning / I hit it first, Ray J or Ron Jeremy / They bleed like us so them niggas could never scare me / No niggas got more glow than JID, barely scratchin' the fucking surface / You need work, you need purpose / Everybody good, everybody trap perfect / Everything cool, don't nobody act nervous / Just ignore the fact that your favorite rap nigga is a sap nigga / We don't dap niggas, get the rrrat from the ratchet / Get the pack out the package / Lil' savage ass, ratchet ass, bastard ass, havin' ass / Rappin' ass, jackin' ass, wait / Finna blast, green dot, send the cash, pen and pad / Minivan, been a dad, been with that bullshit, nigga / I don't wake up to the bull like I usually do / Young niggas down the block on the woopty woop / Better pray to God they don't shoot at you / Dreams of cleanin' this dirty money out my cuticles / Then a nigga make the crowd jump like Zoboomafoo / Shit's beautiful, shit's beautiful / Shit's beautiful, shit's beautiful, shit's beautiful / ___________ / Name NEVER / Artist JID / Album The Never Story"/>
