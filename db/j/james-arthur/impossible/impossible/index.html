<title>James Arthur â€“ Impossible | Lyrics</title>
<meta name="description" content="I remember years ago / Someone told me I should take / Caution when it comes to love / I did / And You were strong and I was not / My illusion, my mistake / I was careless I forgot / I did / And now when all is done / There is nothing to say / You have gone and so effortlessly / You have won / You can go ahead tell them / Tell them all I know now / Shout it from the roof tops / Write it on the sky line / All we had is gone now / Tell them I was happy / And my heart is broken / All my scars are open / Tell them what I hoped would be / Impossible, impossible / Impossible, impossible / Falling out of love is hard / Falling for betrayal is worst / Broken trust and broken hearts / I know, I know / Thinking all you need is there / Building faith on love and words / Empty promises will wear / I know, I know / And now when all is gone / There is nothing to say / And if you're done with embarrassing me / On your own you can go ahead tell them / Tell them all I know now / Shout it from the roof tops / Write it on the sky line / All we had is gone now / Tell them I was happy / And my heart is broken / All my scars are open / Tell them what I hoped would be / Impossible, impossible / Impossible, impossible / I remember years ago / Someone told me I should take / Caution when it comes to love / I did / Tell them all I know now / Shout it from the roof tops / Write it on the sky line / All we had is gone now / Tell them I was happy / And my heart is broken / I hoped would be / Impossible, impossible / Impossible, impossible / Impossible, impossible / Impossible, impossible / ________________ / Name Impossible / Artist James Arthur / Album Impossible"/>
