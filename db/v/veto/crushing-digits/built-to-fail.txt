I was giving you
Some kind of a present.
I was giving you
'though your more than i discern.
And i was put in to give you
Everything that you need.
But instead i do
Whatever it is i please.

And i was built to give you
More than i do now.
And i was built to show you
More than i do now.
And i was put in to give you
The world on a platter.
But instead i just sit here
And do nothing that really matters.

And i was built to give you
More than i do now.
And i was built to show you
More than i do now.
And i was put in to give you
The world on a platter.
But instead i just sit here
And do nothing that really matters.

You lift me up from
The world of falling.
You kept me going and this is how i thank you. (x11)
