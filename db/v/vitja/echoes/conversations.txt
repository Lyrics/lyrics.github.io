You wanna know why I am so silent
why I used to swallow all of my words
There is too much talk and only deaf ears
It wouldn't make a difference

I never found out whats right or wrong
Show me the place where I belong

Can you cut the cord
Can you show me what it's for?
Take my hand,(and) let me discover inspiration

Lead me
and I will follow (wherever you go) (I will follow)
Force me
and you could find the deepest in me (deepest in me)
Stand your ground
when I agree please say no

I never found out whats right or wrong
Show me the place where I belong

They had it all
Fucking false friends
All

Lets have a conversation I will ask and you will tell
Save me from the gallows I'll save you from yourself

So here's the deal

Save me from the gallows
And ill save you from yourself

Save me from the gallows
