I'm so happy, 'cause today I've found my friends
They're in my head, I'm so ugly, that's okay, 'cause so are you
We've broke our mirrors, Sunday morning, is every day for all I care
And I'm not scared, light my candles, in a daze, 'cause I've found God

Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Yeah

I'm so lonely, that's okay, I shaved my head
And I'm not sad and just maybe I'm to blame for all I've heard
But I'm not sure, I'm so excited, I can't wait to meet you there
But I don't care, I'm so horny, that's okay, my will is good

Yeah, yeah

I love you, I'm not gonna crack, I killed you, I'm not gonna crack
I like it, I'm not gonna crack, I miss you, I'm not gonna crack
I love you, I'm not gonna crack, I killed you, I'm not gonna crack
