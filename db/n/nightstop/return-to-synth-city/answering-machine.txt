You told me
to move on.
Not to be so tragic
You told me to listen
But all I hear is static

Wooo why I'm even waiting?
Wooo-o it feels like I'm just fainting
Wooo why I'm even waiting
Wooo it feels like I'm just fainting.

I love you
and you love me
Baby you just forgot to call me
I love you
and you love me
Baby you just forgot to call me

Wooo-o why I'm even waiting?
Wooo-o it feels like I'm just fainting.
Wooo-o why I'm even waiting?
Wooo-o it feel like I'm just fainting.

I waited for your call
but I waited too long
I just keep listening
to your answering machine

Answering machine
Answering machine
Answering machine

Wooo-o why I'm even waiting?
Wooo-o it feels like I'm just fainting
Wooo-o why I'm even waiting
Wooo-o it feels like I'm just fainting
