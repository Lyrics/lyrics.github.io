<title>Nightwish â€“ The Poet And The Pendulum | Lyrics</title>
<meta name="description" content="I. "WHITE LANDS OF EMPATHICA" / The end. / The songwriter's dead. / The blade fell upon him / Taking him to the white lands / Of Empathica / Of Innocence / Empathica / Innocence / II. "HOME" / The dreamer and the wine / Poet without a rhyme / A widowed writer torn apart by chains of hell / One last perfect verse / Is still the same old song / Oh Christ how I hate what I have become / Take me home / Getaway, runaway, fly away / Lead me astray to dreamer's hideaway / I cannot cry 'cause the shoulder cries more / I cannot die, I, a whore for the cold world / Forgive me / I have but two faces / One for the world / One for God / Save me / I cannot cry 'cause the shoulder cries more / I cannot die, I, a whore for the cold world / My home was there 'n then / Those meadows of heaven / Adventure-filled days / One with every smiling face / Please, no more words / Thoughts from a severed head / No more praise / Tell me once my heart goes right / Take me home / Getaway, runaway, fly away / Lead me astray to dreamer's hideaway / I cannot cry 'cause the shoulder cries more / I cannot die, I, a whore for the cold world / Forgive me / I have but two faces / One for the world / One for God / Save me / I cannot cry 'cause the shoulder cries more / I cannot die, I, a whore for the cold world / Whore for the cold world / Whore for the cold world / III. "THE PACIFIC" / Sparkle my scenery / With turquoise waterfall / With beauty underneath / The Ever Free / Tuck me in beneath the blue / Beneath the pain, beneath the rain / Goodnight kiss for a child in time / Swaying blade my lullaby / On the shore we sat and hoped / Under the same pale moon / Whose guiding light chose you / Chose you all / "I'm afraid, so afraid. / Being raped again, and again, and again / I know I will die alone. / But loved. / You live long enough to hear the sound of guns, / long enough to find yourself screaming every night, / long enough to see your friends betray you. / For years I've been strapped unto this altar. / Now I only have three minutes and counting. / I just wish the tide would catch me first and give me a death I always longed for." / IV. "DARK PASSION PLAY" / Second robber to the right of Christ / Cut in half - infanticide / The world will rejoice today / As the crows feast on the rotting poet / Everyone must bury their own / No pack to bury the heart of stone / Now he's home in hell, serves him well / Slain by the bell, tolling for his farewell / The morning dawned, upon his altar / Remains of the dark passion play / Performed by his friends without shame / Spitting on his grave as they came / Getaway, runaway, fly away / Lead me astray to dreamer's hideaway / I cannot cry 'cause the shoulder cries more / I cannot die, I, a whore for the cold world / Forgive me / I have but two faces / One for the world / One for God / Save me / I cannot cry 'cause the shoulder cries more / I cannot die, I, a whore for the cold world / Whore for the cold world / Whore for the cold world / "Today, in the year of our Lord 2005, / Tuomas was called from the cares of the world. / He stopped crying at the end of each beautiful day. / The music he wrote had too long been without silence. / He was found naked and dead, / With a smile in his face, a pen and one thousand pages of erased text." / Save me / V. "MOTHER & FATHER" / Be still, my son / You're home / Oh when did you become so cold? / The blade will keep on descending / All you need is to feel my love / Search for beauty, find your shore / Try to save them all, bleed no more / You have such oceans within / In the end / I will always love you / The beginning. / _______________________________ / Name The Poet And The Pendulum / Artist Nightwish / Album Dark Passion Play"/>
