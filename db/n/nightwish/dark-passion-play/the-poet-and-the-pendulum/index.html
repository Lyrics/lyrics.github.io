"WHITE LANDS OF EMPATHICA"</p><p>The end.</p><p>The songwriter's dead.<br/>The blade fell upon him<br/>Taking him to the white lands<br/>Of Empathica<br/>Of Innocence<br/>Empathica<br/>Innocence</p><p>II. "HOME"</p><p>The dreamer and the wine<br/>Poet without a rhyme<br/>A widowed writer torn apart by chains of hell</p><p>One last perfect verse<br/>Is still the same old song<br/>Oh Christ how I hate what I have become</p><p>Take me home</p><p>Getaway, runaway, fly away<br/>Lead me astray to dreamer's hideaway<br/>I cannot cry 'cause the shoulder cries more<br/>I cannot die, I, a whore for the cold world<br/>Forgive me<br/>I have but two faces<br/>One for the world<br/>One for God<br/>Save me<br/>I cannot cry 'cause the shoulder cries more<br/>I cannot die, I, a whore for the cold world</p><p>My home was there 'n then<br/>Those meadows of heaven<br/>Adventure-filled days<br/>One with every smiling face</p><p>Please, no more words<br/>Thoughts from a severed head<br/>No more praise<br/>Tell me once my heart goes right</p><p>Take me home</p><p>Getaway, runaway, fly away<br/>Lead me astray to dreamer's hideaway<br/>I cannot cry 'cause the shoulder cries more<br/>I cannot die, I, a whore for the cold world<br/>Forgive me<br/>I have but two faces<br/>One for the world<br/>One for God<br/>Save me<br/>I cannot cry 'cause the shoulder cries more<br/>I cannot die, I, a whore for the cold world<br/>Whore for the cold world<br/>Whore for the cold world</p><p>III. "THE PACIFIC"</p><p>Sparkle my scenery<br/>With turquoise waterfall<br/>With beauty underneath<br/>The Ever Free</p><p>Tuck me in beneath the blue<br/>Beneath the pain, beneath the rain<br/>Goodnight kiss for a child in time<br/>Swaying blade my lullaby</p><p>On the shore we sat and hoped<br/>Under the same pale moon<br/>Whose guiding light chose you<br/>Chose you all</p><p>"I'm afraid, so afraid.<br/>Being raped again, and again, and again<br/>I know I will die alone.<br/>But loved.</p><p>You live long enough to hear the sound of guns,<br/>long enough to find yourself screaming every night,<br/>long enough to see your friends betray you.</p><p>For years I've been strapped unto this altar.<br/>Now I only have three minutes and counting.<br/>I just wish the tide would catch me first and give me a death I always longed for."</p><p>IV. "DARK PASSION PLAY"</p><p>Second robber to the right of Christ<br/>Cut in half - infanticide<br/>The world will rejoice today<br/>As the crows feast on the rotting poet</p><p>Everyone must bury their own<br/>No pack to bury the heart of stone<br/>Now he's home in hell, serves him well<br/>Slain by the bell, tolling for his farewell</p><p>The morning dawned, upon his altar<br/>Remains of the dark passion play<br/>Performed by his friends without shame<br/>Spitting on his grave as they came</p><p>Getaway, runaway, fly away<br/>Lead me astray to dreamer's hideaway<br/>I cannot cry 'cause the shoulder cries more<br/>I cannot die, I, a whore for the cold world<br/>Forgive me<br/>I have but two faces<br/>One for the world<br/>One for God<br/>Save me<br/>I cannot cry 'cause the shoulder cries more<br/>I cannot die, I, a whore for the cold world<br/>Whore for the cold world<br/>Whore for the cold world</p><p>"Today, in the year of our Lord 2005,<br/>Tuomas was called from the cares of the world.<br/>He stopped crying at the end of each beautiful day.<br/>The music he wrote had too long been without silence.</p><p>He was found naked and dead,<br/>With a smile in his face, a pen and one thousand pages of erased text."</p><p>Save me</p><p>V. "MOTHER & FATHER"</p><p>Be still, my son<br/>You're home<br/>Oh when did you become so cold?<br/>The blade will keep on descending<br/>All you need is to feel my love</p><p>Search for beauty, find your shore<br/>Try to save them all, bleed no more<br/>You have such oceans within<br/>In the end<br/>I will always love you</p><p>The beginning.</p></article></div>
