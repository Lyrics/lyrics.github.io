You scream and we're gone - falling out
There must have been times in the smoke and the beat on the dance-floor
When all of the doors, they were opening for you
There must have been times when you thought you were kings of the whole world
With the chemicals eating away at your reason
But now you're shut down, closed in
We build our own little jails
I've had to watch this thing so many times
Another little death of innocence
Ch: Now, we scream, you run - fall out
You scream and we're gone - falling out

None of us saw the clever image you hold of yourselves
The things that you thought were so cool were just a joke to everyone else
Didn't they tell you when you pulled a stupid expression
That when the wind changed you'd be stuck with it forever?
And now you're shut down, closed in, with all the money you owe
I've had to watch this thing so many times
Another little death of innocence
Ch: We scream, you run - fall out
You scream and we're gone - falling out</div></div>
