<div><pre>I'll teach you everything that I know now, Eddie
If you really want to take the time
But don't expect to get answers to anything, Eddie
There is just one thing I've learned
Through everything that I've done and tried
Everything I have justified
It's all vanity, all vanity - we try to have control
It's all vanity, all vanity 'cause Chaos rules it all

I always drive like a madman, Eddie
But you'll soon get used to that
I believe if you're moving fast enough, Eddie
You don't ever have to watch your back
I choose solid ground to make my stands
I stay off the streets at closing time
It's all vanity, all vanity - we try to have control
It's all vanity, all vanity 'cause Chaos rules it all

Remember how it was out at Bunglass
We climbed up to the peak and stood against the rocks
The photographs came - you couldn't see us
We were lost against the mountains like specks of dust
And the mirror never lies, it's just these foolish eyes
And we all see what we want to see
What we need to see, what we have to see
And so will you do just the same one day, Eddie
I've been to that place a thousand times
Looked over the edge so many times
Wanted to jump a thousand times

Well we talk about saving the world now, Eddie
It's our vanity gone mad
She'll survive us all perfectly well
When we're all long buried and dead
Clever monkeys with technology
Barely out of the caves and the trees
It's all vanity, all vanity - we try to have control
It's all vanity, all vanity 'cause Chaos rules it all
Eddie now let it go . . .
I turn my head away from here
Down towards the rolling seas again
I kneel and worship where I can
The ground comes swirling up and through these veins . . .</pre></div>
