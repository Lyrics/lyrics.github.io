Get up early every morning
Just to put your makeup on
The wardrobe's full of useless clothes
Your winter coats are gone
The jackal pack is feeding
The motorway sweeps down
The council tries to bribe the rich
Just to stay in town

Get me out
Get me out of this place
Get me out of this trap
Get me out of my brain

Ysidro down to Melbourne
The pressure starts to build
The bullets fly at random
When you least expect they will
Everybody feels guilty
So anyone can pay
I'm just surprised it doesn't happen every bloody day

Get me out
Get me out of this place
Get me out of this trap
Get me out of my brain

So here come the nineties
The temperature is rising
I cannot seem to lose the stains
When I wash my hands
One world is rising
One world is dying
And one has got its precious head
Buried in the sand

Get me out
Get me out of this place
Get me out of this trap
Get me out of my brain
