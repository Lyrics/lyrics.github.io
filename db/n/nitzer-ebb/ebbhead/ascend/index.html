    <div class="view"><pre>I first saw you
Without love but then you knew
Your fingers reached
I moved in, the distance breached

Tell me what I'm doing here
Tell me what I'm doing here

To my surprise I kissed you
You made me rise
Now by my side, I've missed you
And let it slide

Tell me what I'm doing here
Tell me what I'm doing here

If all I ever wanted wasn't good for you
If the things that I said, they just weren't true
Ascend, ascend my friend

I turned my head and looked back
I had been led
When my heart jumped, we lost touch
Our love had slumped

Tell me what I'm doing here
Tell me what I'm doing here

If all I ever wanted wasn't good for you
If the things that I said, they just weren't true
Then don't restrain from coming here
It causes pain, you're so sincere
Ascend, I must ascend

So now alone
I find out your heart is stone
A helping hand?
There is none from where I stand

Tell me what I'm doing here
Tell me what I'm doing here

If all I ever wanted wasn't good for you
If the things that I said, they just weren't true
Then don't restrain from telling me
That all this pain is good for me

I can see you looking down to keep away from me
But I'm stuck with this lack of ability
I can't refrain from coming here
It causes pain, you're so sincere
Ascend</pre></div>
