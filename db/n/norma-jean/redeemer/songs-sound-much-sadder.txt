We'll be legends
We are smashed men, still moving
We've tried everything in the book
No stranger to failure, death with a steady heartbeat
Scratching into any surface it wants
Joy and beauty rejected so many times
A world of hurt, a heart of false hope

And while we thought that we were learning how to live
We have been learning how to die
I should have known, we will be legends

Our hopes and dreams, our worst nightmares
Our worst nightmares have now come true
Tonight when this deep sleep falls on men
Driven by an instinct more powerful than life itself
From horror to hope, from hope and devastation

And while we thought that we were learning how to live
We have been learning how to die
I should have known, we will be legends

Overfed and unconcerned
It came with teeth and claw
Oh, hated form of emotion
You have become so obvious
My friend, the fatal habit of being myself

Ok, there's hope, step down with all your friends
