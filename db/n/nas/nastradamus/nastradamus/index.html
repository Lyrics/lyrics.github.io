<title>Nas â€“ Nastradamus | Lyrics</title>
<meta name="description" content="Uh, 2000 G / Yo, I need an encore y'all, you should welcome me back / You wanna ball till you fall, I can help you with that / You want beef? I could let a slug melt in your hat / Cuz I'm a wild barbarian, too hard, I'm scarin' 'em / Century 21 solar eclipse / While you listenin' to the words that I wrote on the disc / I slob knobs like I was on the street / Felonious, my description is do-rags, pants sag down to my feet / AK is my heat, 8th Day in the street till I lay six feet / QB, PJs, and we playin' for keeps / Jewelry, cars and Jeeps is my motto / Four-fives with the hollows, silencers on the nozzles / Pop bottles with those who left here / The best years, we in a bulletproof vest years / The aim for the head and chest years / What's your name? Make your name known / For the next year's, better rep, yeah / 1 - Nasty, Nas the Esco to Escobar / Naughty, it's Nastradamus / Nasty, Nas the Esco to Escobar / Naughty, it's Nastrodamus / Repeat 1 / I let y'all niggas bang my shit before Saddam hits / Let Nastrodamus tell us what time it is / I was the first one on that Don shit / First nigga to sing a hook on some TJ Swan shit / Black ski masks up in the projects, camoulflage, full clips / Run up in your crib, tie up your bitch / Weigh the bricks and we loco, so broke, brown coke won't sell / Spendin' your money on weed, smoke and hotels / Hood rats and bullet wound up females / Got babies by hustlers and niggaz in jail / Slingin for chips and fiends with burnt finger tips / Base heads, killed cab drivers just for a hit / A week later, sportin' Gators, gettin' thrills / Our honies wearin' Gucci high heels / She come to scoop me, I chill / Leave streets alone for a sec / Hit the sky bar, sunset, and the sex is so high-tech / Uh / Repeat 1 / Repeat 1 / Now, lounge homeboy, you in the Godly zone / Rest in peace, Ill Will, now your name's in the throne / We gon' rep it the best that we can / Physically, you was killed by the weapons of man / But where you at now, you lamp laid in Mac's now / Where Bravehearts put they rap down in honor of your name, you a legend / And they don't understand how you see over from heaven / But that's another level, brethren / Tow G's, we got the type fam with Mac 11's / We do squeeze, thought it's not right / But that's the zone that we left in / Bentleys, Porches, DRJ watches / Sick with the bread, Lamborghini trucks topless / Laptops with 100 gigabytes, ninja bikes / And we all roll dice, for each other's ice / And how does one guy multiply to more than five wise guys? / But only one man, only the mind's eyes, can understand that I'm... / Repeat 1 / Repeat 1 / Ill Will / Nastrodamus / New LP for the 2G / Uh / Bravehearts / Nation / Big Things / Lucciano / Oh, the Lord again / M-O-B-B Deep / Zaire / Crack / Cocaine / Yeah / Hoe / Jungle / Raise hope / _________________ / Name Nastradamus / Artist Nas / Album Nastradamus"/>
