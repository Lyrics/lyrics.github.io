If I had a hatchet
It would be yours to have
'Cause your decapitating habits feel a little bit orgasmic
If I gave you a hatchet
It would be yours to have
I kind of like the feeling when you stab me in the back
Every time i see you
Look me in the eye
I look straight back
'Cause a part of me will die
If I had a hatchet
It would be yours to have
No amount of pain would ever stop me coming back

If I had a pistol
It would be yours to have
You could shoot me in the head blow a hole in my back
If I gave you a pistol
I wouldn't need it back
You could aim between my eyes and I'd still be yours to have
Every time I see you
I've got the urge to cry
I'm holding back the tears
'Cause I know the reason why
If I had a pistol
It would be yours to have
No amount of pain would ever stop me coming back
To you

If I had an army
It would be yours to reign
People think I'm crazy but the pain is worth the pain
If I gave you an army
It would be your command
Kick me to the ground break both my bands
Every time your hurt me
I want you even more
I'll never win the battle and I'll never win the war
If I had an army
It would be yours to have
No amount of pain would ever stop me coming back
To you

Every time I see you
Look me in the eye
I look straight back
'Cause a part of me will die
If I had a hatchet
It would be yours to have
No amount of pain would ever stop me coming back
To you

Every time i see you
Look me in the eye
I look straight back
'Cause a part of me will die
If I had a hatchet
It would be yours to have
No amount of pain would ever stop me coming back
To you

Bound to you
Bound to you
Bound to you
I'm bound to you
