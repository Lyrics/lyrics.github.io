Never really know what happens
Never really know what's in there
Always have to tell me nothing
Nothings ever really there
Baby, well you know that I love you
But loving you is just too obscene
Baby, well you know I hate you
But hating you would be too fair

Never really know what happens
You never really take me there
Fair to you is so important
Nothings ever really there

Emptiness is so distorted
Twisting me and bending my heart
Emptiness is so distorted
Leaving me hear
It's so dark

Empathy is so tormenting
Disturbing me and bending my soul
Emptiness is so distorted
Twisting, Devastating my heart

Leaving me hear
It's so dark
(Twisting me)

Still, the lights are far away
And the Shadows overlay

(Twisting me)
It's so dark
(Twisting me)
It's so dark
