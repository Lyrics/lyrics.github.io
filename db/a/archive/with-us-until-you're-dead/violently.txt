Who the fuck
Who the fuck is anything
You wore me down
Mentally
Gonna wear you down
Physically
Amputate your soul
There's a picture in my mouth

Quietly fucked
Quietly gone
Quietly fucked
Quietly gone
Reality of this
Shy away from this

Demonic presence hanging over me
Poison venoms hanging over me
Forcing venom taking over me
Splitting veins its hanging over
Hanging over
Hanging over

Who the fuck

Who the fuck is anything
I'm buried now
Burning deep
Underground
It died in me
It died in me
It died in me
So violently
Who the fuck is anything
You broke me down
Mentally
Gonna take you down
Violently
So violently
So violently
I'm mentally fucked

When I close my eyes
I think of how you died
Died in me
So violently
Love to close my eyes
Remember how you died
Died in me
So violently
Quietly
Quietly
Quietly
Gone
