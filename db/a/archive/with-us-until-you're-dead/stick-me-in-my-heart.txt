Stick it in my heart
Stick it in my heart
Stick it in my heart

Sacrifice my heart how I want it
Crave the pain you give 'Cause I need it
Claw away my skin then I see it
Losing all my mind 'til I find it
You are all that cuts and is biting
You are all the things that enlight me
Take away you're here and I'm nothing
Just and empty hole
I am nothing
Take away my fear
Please do something
Everything that is
Is love about you

Stick me in my heart
Stick me in my heart
Stick me in my heart

Feeling you insane how I need it
Feeling all your pain
How I hold it
Crashing through your walls
Like a hammer
Smashing up the floors
Of your thinking
Pull me through the cracks when you're sinking
Pull me how you like
God I'm trying
Seeing all your life
When it's dying
Dragging me,
It kills when you're fighting
Everything that is
Is love about you

Stick me in my heart so I feel it
Take me with your tears so I feel it
Sharing all your love
Now I feel it
Bring it back to life
I don't feel it
Stick me in my heart
So I feel it
Sharing all your love
Now I feel it
Hold me in your love
'Cause love,
Hold me in your love 'cause love is everything
Love is everything
