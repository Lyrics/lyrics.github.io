I hate your face right now
I can't stand a sight of you
So please
Leave me alone

I thought you were a friend
But you've ruined my tale again
So please
Just go away

How could this happen
Such change of heart
Now I can't stand to be around you
I can't bear to be this near to you

Don't believe a word I say
Don't believe a word I say
Don't believe a word I say
Don't believe a word I say
