I'm thinking of you
In my sleep
They're not good thoughts
The worst kind of sad
I've noticed things
Cannot be repaired
When I wake up
I'll be in despair

'Cause I know I've got to say
I know I've got to say
Goodbye
Baby goodbye
Goodbye
Baby goodbye
You're my sweetheart
Goodbye
You're my sweetest
Goodbye

I know I'm gonna look
So so so so bad
But there's no easier way
For me to have to walk away
But I don't want to hear this no more
And I don't want to feel this no more
And I don't want to see this no more
And I don't want to experience this no more

'Cause I know I've got to say
I know I've got to say
Goodbye
Baby goodbye
Goodbye
Baby goodbye
You're my sweetheart
Goodbye
You're my sweetest
Goodbye
Goodbye
Goodbye
Goodbye (You're my sweetest)
