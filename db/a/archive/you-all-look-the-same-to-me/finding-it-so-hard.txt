I'm finding it so hard
To communicate with you
I'm finding it so hard
To show myself to you
'Cause these feelings
Won't go away
God give me the strength
To get over this
So I can keep my love in here

I'm finding it so hard
To see reason with you
I'm finding it so hard
To show my love to you
'Cause these emotions
Won't come out of here
God give me the power
To love again
So I can feel my heart again

I'm finding it so hard
To make my life with you
I'm finding it so hard
To let myself be with you
'Cause this selfishness won't go away
Lock myself up when you're with me
So free me
So I can love again
Just free me

I'm finding it so hard
To communicate with you
I'm finding it so hard
To show myself to you
'Cause these emotions
Won't come out of here
Lock myself up when you're with me
When you're with me
When you're with me

Over me

Did you phone
Over me my love
Over me
Tell me why
Did you phone
Over me my love
