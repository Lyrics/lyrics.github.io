    <div class="view"><pre>You're tearing me apart
Crushing me inside
You used to lift me up
Now you get me down

If I was to walk away
From you, my love
Could I laugh again?
If I walk away from you
And leave my love
Could I laugh again?
Again, again...

You're killing me again
Am I still in your head?
You used to light me up
Now you shove me down

If I was to walk away
From you, my love
Could I laugh again?
If I walk away from you
And leave my love
Could I laugh again?

I'm losing you again
Lacking me inside
I used to lift you up
Now I get you down

Without your love
You're tearing me apart
With you close by
You're crushing me inside
Without your love
You're tearing me apart
Without your love
I'm doused in madness
I can't lose the sadness
Can't lose the sadness

Can't lose the sadness

You're tearing me apart
Crushing me inside
Without your love
(You used to lift me up)
You're crushing me inside
(Now you get me down)
With you close by
I'm doused in madness
Can't lose the sadness

It's ripping me apart
It's tearing me apart
It's tearing me apart
I don't know how
It's ripping me apart
It's tearing me apart
It's tearing me apart
I don't know why
I don't know why
I don't know why
I don't know why

Without your love
Without your love
Without your love
Without your love
It's tearing me apart</pre></div>
