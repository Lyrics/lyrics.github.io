Hear footsteps creak the floor
The shadows give away
Someone outside the door
Won't let 'em in

Life damaged, gears to grind
A run down broke machine
That steals your peace of mind
Before you know it's gone

(lay, down, lay)

Silence burning, hold your tongue
Keep us separate, sullen, dumb
Hiding in a darkness under
Boiling to the surface, stumble, fall

A looking in view too long on the outside
Desperate plans make sense in a low life

A looking in view too long on the outside
Desperate plans make sense in a low life

These things I hate in you
Also reflect, it seems
Distortion laced with spite
Takes you out of me

(lay, down, lay)

Hiding in a darkness under
Boiling to the surface something
Crawling on your skin, discomfort
Makes you break and run, stumble, fall

A looking in view too long on the outside
Desperate plans make sense in a low life

A looking in view too long on the outside
Desperate plans make sense in a low life

It's why you never tell me whatever's on your mind
It's why you never tell me whatever's on your mind
It's why you never tell me whatever's on your mind
It's why you never tell me whatever's on your

A looking in view too long on the outside
Desperate plans make sense in a low life

A looking in view too long on the outside
Desperate plans make sense in a low life

It's why you never tell me whatever's on your mind
