<title>Alice In Chains â€“ Sea of Sorrow | Lyrics</title>
<meta name="description" content="Mind of destructive taste / I choose to stroll amongst the waste / That was your heart lost in the dark / Call off the chase / Walls of thought, strong and high / As my castle crumbles with time / I think of you, oh yes I do / Such a crime / You opened fire, and your mark was true / You opened fire, aim my smiling skull at you / You opened fire / I live tomorrow, you I'll not follow / As you wallow in a sea of sorrow / Lines cut across my face / Why you laugh at my disgrace? / I'll never know how far to go / To reach that place / You opened fire, and your mark was true / You opened fire, aim my smiling skull at you / You opened fire / I live tomorrow, you I'll not follow / As you wallow in a sea of sorrow / You opened fire, and your mark was true / You opened fire, aim my smiling skull at you / You opened fire / I live tomorrow, you I'll not follow / As you wallow in a sea of sorrow / I live tomorrow, you I'll not follow / As you wallow in a sea of sorrow / I live tomorrow, you I'll not follow / As you wallow in a sea of sorrow / I live tomorrow, you I'll not follow / As you wallow in a sea of sorrow / ________________ / Name Sea of Sorrow / Artist Alice In Chains / Album Facelift / Year 1990"/>
