Sad suffering
I knew him when
Fair weather friend of mine

Try not to think
I merely blink
Hope you wish away the lies

I...

Can you protect
Me when I'm wrecked?
I pretend you're still alive

I...

Ye-yea...

(Who will deny all the time your lies?)
(Who will deny all the time your lies?)

I choose the day
One damp and gray
Thick fog that hide our smiles

Clear all your sins
Get born again
Just repeat a couple lines

I...

Lies

Ye-yea...

(Who will deny all the time your lies?)

Can you protect
Me when I'm wrecked?
I pretend you're still alive

I choose the day
One damp and gray
Thick fog that hide our smiles

Sad suffering
(Who will deny all the time your lies?)
Get born again
(Who will deny all the time your lies?)

Sad suffering
(Who will deny all the time your lies?)
Get born again
(Who will deny all the time your lies?)

Sad suffering
(Who will deny all the time your lies?)
Get born again
(Who will deny all the time your lies?)

Sad suffering
(Who will deny all the time your lies?)
Get born again
(Who will deny all the time your lies?)

Sad suffering
(Who will deny all the time your lies?)
Get born again
(Who will deny all the time your lies?)
