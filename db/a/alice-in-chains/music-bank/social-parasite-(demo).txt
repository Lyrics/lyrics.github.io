Hoa!

You say you don't like the way we look?
Well fuck off
I ain't some dying dog that you can kick
So fuck off

It's so easy to fall into that hole
And you're the one who cast me in that role

If you loved me would you call me a social parasite?
And who's the one to tell me whether it's wrong or right?

You say you don't like the place I'm in?
Well get out
There ain't no vacancy in my bed
So get out

It's so easy to fall into that hole
And you're the one who cast me in that role

If you loved me would you call me a social parasite?
And who's the one to tell me whether it's wrong or right?

If you loved me would you call me a social parasite?
And who's the one to tell me whether it's wrong or right?

One, two, three, go!

You say you don't like the way we look?
Well fuck off
I ain't some dying dog that you can kick
So fuck off

It's so easy to fall into that hole
And you're the one who cast me in that role

If you loved me would you call me a social parasite?
And who's the one to tell me whether it's wrong or right?

If you loved me would you call me a social parasite?
And who's the one to tell me whether it's wrong or right?
