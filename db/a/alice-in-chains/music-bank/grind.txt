In the darkest hole, you'd be well advised
Not to plan my funeral 'fore the body dies, yeah

Come the morning light, it's a see-through show
What you may have heard and what you think you know, yeah

Let the sun never blind your eyes
Let me sleep so my teeth won't grind
Hear a sound from a voice inside

Sure you play your part, so you love the game
And in truth your lies become one and same, yeah

I could set you free, rather hear the sound
Of your body breaking as I take you down, yeah

Let the sun never blind your eyes
Let me sleep so my teeth won't grind
Hear a sound from a voice inside

In the darkest hole, you'd be well advised
Not to plan my funeral 'fore the body dies, yeah

Let the sun never blind your eyes
Let me sleep so my teeth won't grind
Hear a sound from a voice inside

Let the sun never blind your eyes
Let me sleep so my teeth won't grind
Hear a sound from a voice inside
