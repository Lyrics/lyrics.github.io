<title>Alice In Chains – Down In A Hole | Lyrics</title>
<meta name="description" content="Whoo-hoo-hoo… / Bury me softly in this womb / I give this part of me for you / Sand rains down and here I sit / Holding rare flowers in a tomb… (in bloom) / Down in a hole and I don't know if I can be saved / See my heart I decorate it like a grave / Oh, you don't understand who they thought I was supposed to be / Look at me now I'm a man who won't let himself be / Down in a hole, / Feeling so small / Down in a hole, / Losing my soul / I'd like to fly, / But my wings have been so denied / Down in a hole and they've put all the stones in their place / I've eaten the sun so my tongue has been burned of the taste / I have been guilty of kicking myself in the teeth / I will speak no more of my feelings beneath / Down in a hole, / Feeling so small / Down in a hole, / Losing my soul / I'd like to fly, / But my wings have been so denied / (Bury me softly in this womb) / Oh I want to be inside of you / (I give this part of me for you) / Oh I want to be inside of you / (Sand rains down and here I sit) / (Holding rare flowers) Oh I want to be inside of you / In a tomb… (in bloom) / Oh I want to be inside… / Down in a hole, / Feeling so small / Down in a hole, / Losing my soul / Down in a hole, / Feeling so small / Down in a hole, / Losing my soul / I'd like to fly, / But my wings have been so denied / ____________________ / Name Down In A Hole / Artist Alice In Chains / Album Dirt / Year 1992"/>
