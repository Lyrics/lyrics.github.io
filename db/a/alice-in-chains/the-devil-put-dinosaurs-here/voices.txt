Who am I?
Is this me?
Am I one?
Or thirteen?

I've gone cold
Hard to deal
Used to stand
Where I kneel

Everybody, listen:
Voices in my head
Everybody, listen:
Does yours say what mine says?

I want more
Than I need
I don't know
What is real

Everybody, listen:
Voices in my head
Everybody, listen:
Does yours say what mine says?

Anytime I listen:
Voices in my head
Everybody, listen:
Does yours say what mine says?

Whispering of names,
Faces,
Uniforms I've worn
And all that is gone

Always climbing
To fall down again
Holding onto everything
It's not what it seems

I've been told
Dreaming is free
Think I'll go
Back to sleep

Everybody, listen:
Voices in my head
Everybody, listen:
Does yours say what mine says?

Anytime I listen:
Voices in my head
Everybody, listen:
Does yours say what mine says?

Calling out the names,
Faces,
Uniforms I've worn
And all that is gone

Always climbing
To fall down again
Holding onto everything
It's not what it seems
