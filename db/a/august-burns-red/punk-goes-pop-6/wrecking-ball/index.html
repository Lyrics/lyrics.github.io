<title>August Burns Red â€“ Wrecking Ball | Lyrics</title>
<meta name="description" content="We clawed, we chained our hearts in vain / We jumped never asking why / We kissed, I fell under your spell / A love no one could deny / Don&#x27;t you ever say I just walked away / I will always want you / I can&#x27;t live a lie,"/>
