<title>A Day To Remember â€“ Leave All The Lights On | Lyrics</title>
<meta name="description" content="Guess things didn't go the way that you planned / I missed the days when you would understand / The way that I am / You have me feeling lonely and detached / Every time I'm moving forward / We take two steps back / I need to have a moment to myself / County lines, clear my mind with someplace else / Besides this stairwell / Alone and on the road, I'm overwhelmed / I need to find the difference in how I feel and how I felt / Leave all the lights on / And maybe I'll find my way back home / Leave all the lights on / I took this drive to be alone / Leave all the lights on / I wish I could get back to the way things were / When we were young, having fun, so self assured / But now that's all a blur / I miss the way we always used to talk / Now we talk ourselves in circle till we forget why we fought / Leave all the lights on / And maybe I'll find my way back home / Leave all the lights on / I took this drive to be alone / Leave all the lights on / If I'm not worth letting go / Leave all the lights on / If you still care I need to know / Leave all the lights on / This gets me so down down down / Why can't we work it out, can't we work it out? / This makes me so down down down / I've been trying to see, if you were meant for me / You get me so down down down, I'm gonna turn this car around / Just know that it's the last time / Ya it's the last time. / Leave all the lights on / And maybe I'll find my way back home / Leave all the lights on / I took this drive to be alone (Down, down, down) / Leave all the lights on, / If I'm not worth letting go / Leave all the lights on, if you still cared I need to know (Down, down, down) / Leave all the lights on / Guess things didn't go the way that you planned / _____________________________ / Name Leave All The Lights On / Artist A Day To Remember / Album Common Courtesy"/>
