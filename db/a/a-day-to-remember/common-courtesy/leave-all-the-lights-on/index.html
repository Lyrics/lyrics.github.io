    <div class="view"><pre>Guess things didn't go the way that you planned
I missed the days when you would understand
The way that I am
You have me feeling lonely and detached
Every time I'm moving forward
We take two steps back
I need to have a moment to myself
County lines, clear my mind with someplace else
Besides this stairwell
Alone and on the road, I'm overwhelmed
I need to find the difference in how I feel and how I felt

Leave all the lights on
And maybe I'll find my way back home
Leave all the lights on
I took this drive to be alone
Leave all the lights on

I wish I could get back to the way things were
When we were young, having fun, so self assured
But now that's all a blur
I miss the way we always used to talk
Now we talk ourselves in circle till we forget why we fought

Leave all the lights on
And maybe I'll find my way back home
Leave all the lights on
I took this drive to be alone
Leave all the lights on
If I'm not worth letting go
Leave all the lights on
If you still care I need to know
Leave all the lights on

This gets me so down down down
Why can't we work it out, can't we work it out?
This makes me so down down down
I've been trying to see, if you were meant for me
You get me so down down down, I'm gonna turn this car around
Just know that it's the last time
Ya it's the last time.

Leave all the lights on
And maybe I'll find my way back home
Leave all the lights on
I took this drive to be alone (Down, down, down)
Leave all the lights on,
If I'm not worth letting go
Leave all the lights on, if you still cared I need to know (Down, down, down)
Leave all the lights on

Guess things didn't go the way that you planned</pre></div>
