I've been feeling like everything is for nothing
In fact I've never felt so goddamn small
Always searching for the bright side to find the strength for when I fall
I'm still believing that life has a meaning
Cant cope with thinking that there's not
I'm so divided that I try to hide it
It's the only real thing that I've got!

So when the world outside cant see what's wrong and right
People can't understand the reasons that we fight
Somethings gotta give

Violence, give me violence
cause they say we're the worthless ones
Substance, give me substance
Heavy lies the crown as I cut you down

Violence, give me violence
cause they say we're the worthless ones
Substance, give me substance
Heavy lies the crown as I cut you down

You can call this a warning
It's a warning that were drowning in our malcontent
Tear me down like a cancer, whats your answer?
We're different and it makes you sick
There is a sadness here, on every corner
It's in our hearts dear God
Don't wanna trouble you much
But we all need to know when enough is enough

So when the world outside cant see what's wrong and right
People can't understand the reasons that we fight
Somethings gotta give

Violence, give me violence
cause they say we're the worthless ones
Substance, give me substance
Heavy lies the crown as I cut you down

Violence, give me violence
cause they say we're the worthless ones
Substance, give me substance
Heavy lies the crown as I cut you down

You only get one chance and that's one too much
What's the world gonna say when I call your bluff, punk?

Bow your head

Violence, give me violence
cause they say we're the worthless ones
Substance, give me substance
Heavy lies the crown as I cut you down

Violence, give me violence
cause they say we're the worthless ones
Substance, give me substance
Heavy lies the crown as I cut you down
