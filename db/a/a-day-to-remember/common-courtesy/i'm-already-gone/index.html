    <div class="view"><div id="lyrics">As I look 'round this makeshift moving house
I'm searching for whatever's left of me
It's on the ground in a box that reads lost and found
It's lost and found

She said, just let it go
She said, it's all you've ever known

And I'm, I'm already gone
I'm already something to someone
That I don't know
When will I know?

And I'm, I'm out making rounds
On every side of town
That I've been through, that I know
To find my reason to come back home

I've worked it out, you'll always bring me down
From here on out, I'm doing things for me
I'm impatient now, I'm not the type for life alone
I need someone

She said, just let it go
And she said, it's all you've ever known

And I'm, I'm already gone
I'm already something to someone
That I don't know
When will I know?

And I'm, I'm out making rounds
On every side of town
That I've been through, that I know
To find my reason to come back home

With everything that sets me back
I push back harder to clear the way
There's not a thing that I regret
Can't live my life in yesterday

With everything that sets me back
I push back harder to clear the way
There's not a thing that I regret
Can't live my life in yesterday

Life in yesterday

And I'm, I'm already gone
I'm already something to someone
That I don't know
When will I know?

And I'm, I'm out making rounds
On every side of town
That I've been through, that I know
To find my reason to come back home</div></div>
