<div><pre>You're all about you, and it's my fast track to an early grave.
Just need to see this through
Do you even sleep at night?
Where does your conscience run to hide?

I gotta get out, I gotta get out.
Why can't you just do what's right by me?
I gotta get out, I gotta get out.
It can't get much harder, harder to breathe.

The room keeps spinning faster, I'm drifting off to sleep.
Hope it's seen beyond these walls you're suffocating me.
Why can't you see what three little words have done to me?
I never knew I was alone, you turned your back, you broke this home.
Took me so long to find the answers, and your reasons why.
I just wanted things to be alright, or at least for just tonight.

How's living a lie?
You never could face me,
And you hide behind fake personalities
Because deep down you're scared.
So weak beyond compare.

I gotta get out, I gotta get out.
Why can't we just go our separate ways?
I gotta get out, I gotta get out.
It won't be much farther, I'm counting the days.

The room keeps spinning faster, I'm drifting off to sleep.
Hope it's seen beyond these walls, you're suffocating me.
Why can't you see what three little words have done to me?
I never knew I was alone, you turned your back, you broke this home.
Took me so long to find the answers, and your reasons why.
I just wanted things to be alright, or at least for just tonight.

My friends still stand behind me.
We stuck together through all we lost.
Even when your worst surrounds me, you'll never get the best of us.

Why can't you see what three little words have done to me?
I never knew I was alone, you turned your back, you broke this home.
Took me so long to find the answers, and your reasons why.
I just wanted things to be alright, or at least for just tonight

No fucking respect.

All hail the thief forever trying to separate you and me.
All hail the thief forever trying to separate
No fucking respect.</pre></div>
