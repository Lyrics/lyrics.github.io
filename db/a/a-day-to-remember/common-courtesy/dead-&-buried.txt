Let me find the way that I can make do
Without circumstance, without follow through
A man in desperation can't trust a troubled mind
I'm building an empire, say I'm wrong
I don't mind if it's all against one
No room for weakness, I'll be gone forever

Dear mother, as this noose is placed around my neck
I'm reflecting on these past few years I spent trying to forget
I'm regretting all this time spent half the world away
What will the children sing, what will the children sing
When I'm dead and buried?
Dead and buried
Dead and buried
Dead and buried
Dead and buried

I can't fight it
I can't fight it
I can't fight it
I've slipped through the cracks

I hold nothing back

Dear mother, as this noose is placed around my neck
I'm reflecting on these past few years I spent trying to forget
I'm regretting all this time spent half the world away
What will the children sing, what will the children sing
When I'm dead and buried?
Dead and buried
Dead and buried
Dead and buried
Dead and buried

Never thought it'd be easy, 'cause it's not if it's worth to have
It'll pass you by, you have a choice, be your own person, have your own voice

So let's set it off!

Dear mother, as this noose is placed around my neck
I'm reflecting on these past few years I spent trying to forget
I'm regretting all this time spent half the world away
What will the children sing, what will the children sing
When I'm dead and buried?
Dead and buried
Dead and buried
Dead and buried
Dead and buried
