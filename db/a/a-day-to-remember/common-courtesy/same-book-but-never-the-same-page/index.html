    <div class="view"><div id="lyrics">I've lost a part of me
Cause I am just an open book for everyone to see
I always leave empty handed
I can't keep the things that mean the most to me
I'm walking steady on a tightrope
Clinging only to the words that I wrote
I might be temporarily blind but I'm not stupid

Can you tell me how you feel and look me in the face?
I've always wanted to know
I'll go and drop my guard, you put me in my place (In my place, put in my place)
I can't stand it, I don't get it
Nothing ever seems to work when you're around
You always build me up to break me down

I'd give you everything but that would never be good enough
And that's alright with me
You take me for granted
I tried to help you be who you wanna be
I'm a sucker for a complication
And those that are weak at the seams
You weren't worth my time
You weren't worth my time
But still I let you take it from me

Can you tell me how you feel and look me in the face?
I've always wanted to know
I'll go and drop my guard, you put me in my place (In my place, put in my place)
I can't stand it, I don't get it
Nothing ever seems to work when you're around
You always build me up to break me down

Why do I always do this to myself?
Always depending on everyone else
You know it's gonna drive me crazy
You're just a notch in the wall that made me
Why do I always do this to myself?
Always depending on everyone else
You know it's gonna drive me crazy
You're just a notch in the wall that made me

Can you tell me how you feel and look me in the face?
I've always wanted to know
I'll go and drop my guard, you put me in my place (In my place, put in my place)
I can't stand it, I don't get it
Nothing ever seems to work when you're around
You always build me up to break me down
You always build me up to break me down
I said you'll always build me up to break me down

You break me down
You break me down
We never met on middle ground
You break me</div></div>
