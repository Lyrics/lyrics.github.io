You've got secrets, oh yeah,
And I've got a weakness for them.
No this ain't the time or place to show your face,
Cause you know that I can't stand
The need to get even. Tonight,
When everything ya say won't come out right.
So I'll try to save some face, and take my space
Till the times right, cause we'll need it.

So I surrender, I can't forget her.
Will you remember? The truth,
Cause they won't even want me to.

Wish you would read this, oh yeah,
And knew that I mean it. I did.
Yeah I could fill every page with all my ways
That I tried to understand.
Wished things could be different. Alright,
Well it ain't for the lack of how I tried.
So let's go our separate ways, and count the days
As we get by. Cause we'll get by.

So I surrender, I can't forget her.
Will you remember? The truth,
Cause they won't even want me to.

So I surrender, I can't forget her.
Will you remember? The truth

This'll drag on and on and on,
Where I'm the only one who's wrong.
It's always something, it's always something
With me and you.


So I surrender
So I surrender

So I surrender, I can't forget her.
Will you remember? The truth,
Cause they won't even want me to.
They won't even want me to (I, I surrender)
They won't even want me to (I, I surrender)
(I, I surrender)
So I surrender.
