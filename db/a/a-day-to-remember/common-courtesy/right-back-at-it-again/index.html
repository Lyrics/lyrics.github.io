Started out in the spring of 2003
Never went to school, nobody talked to me
Except to tell me all the things I couldn't do
Don't want to hear about it
Got with my guys packed into all our cars
Hit all the nearest scenes and every local bar
Played a show a night till it'd make me sick

So here I am
I'm right back at it again
Just like I've always said
"If you're too cool for school
I ain't here to make no friends"
And I'll say hey! (Hey)!
I'm right back at it again
Just like I've always said
"If you're too cool for school
I ain't here to make no friends"

We left home with no kinda back up plan
And everyone we knew that we couldn't stand
Said if you can't make it here, you won't make it there
Don't want to hear about it
Spent most of our time sleeping on hard wood floors
People's living rooms in any open door
We played a show a night till it all made sense

So here I am
I'm right back at it again
Just like I've always said
"If you're too cool for school
I ain't here to make no friends"
And I'll say hey! (Hey)!
I'm right back at it again
Just like I've always said
"If you're too cool for school
I ain't here to make no friends"

Don't wanna hear about it
Don't wanna hear about it yet

So here I am
I'm right back at it again
Just like I've always said
"If you're too cool for school
I ain't here to make no friends"
And I'll say hey!
I'm right back at it again
Just like I've always said
"If you're too cool for school
I ain't here to make no..." (Brace for impact!)

Don't wanna hear about it
Don't wanna hear about it, bitch</pre></div>
