<title>A Day To Remember â€“ Violence (Enough Is Enough) | Lyrics</title>
<meta name="description" content="I've been feeling like everything is for nothing / In fact I've never felt so goddamn small / Always searching for the bright side to find the strength for when I fall / I'm still believing that life has a meaning / Cant cope with thinking that there's not / I'm so divided that I try to hide it / It's the only real thing that I've got! / So when the world outside cant see what's wrong and right / People can't understand the reasons that we fight / Somethings gotta give / Violence, give me violence / cause they say we're the worthless ones / Substance, give me substance / Heavy lies the crown as I cut you down / Violence, give me violence / cause they say we're the worthless ones / Substance, give me substance / Heavy lies the crown as I cut you down / You can call this a warning / It's a warning that were drowning in our malcontent / Tear me down like a cancer, whats your answer? / We're different and it makes you sick / There is a sadness here, on every corner / It's in our hearts dear God / Don't wanna trouble you much / But we all need to know when enough is enough / So when the world outside cant see what's wrong and right / People can't understand the reasons that we fight / Somethings gotta give / Violence, give me violence / cause they say we're the worthless ones / Substance, give me substance / Heavy lies the crown as I cut you down / Violence, give me violence / cause they say we're the worthless ones / Substance, give me substance / Heavy lies the crown as I cut you down / You only get one chance and that's one too much / What's the world gonna say when I call your bluff, punk? / Bow your head / Violence, give me violence / cause they say we're the worthless ones / Substance, give me substance / Heavy lies the crown as I cut you down / Violence, give me violence / cause they say we're the worthless ones / Substance, give me substance / Heavy lies the crown as I cut you down / _________________________________ / Name Violence (Enough Is Enough) / Artist A Day To Remember / Album Common Courtesy"/>
