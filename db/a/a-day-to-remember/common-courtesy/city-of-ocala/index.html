<title>A Day To Remember â€“ City Of Ocala | Lyrics</title>
<meta name="description" content="Fuck ya! / Remember way back when? They said this life was a dream / Well it still is, and I never wanna wake / Standing in my backyard at our old practice space / Hard to hold back the tears from streaming down my face / That was then, this is now / Ya can't run before you go learn how, and you won't / This is our corner of the world / Where we can come to be ignored / This is our point where we return / This is where I came from / This is where I came from / Remember way back when? This place seemed bigger to me / Learned how to play guitar, and made my mom watch me / We always knew back then, just where I'd be right now / We never questioned it, was more like when and how / That was then, this is now / Ya can't run before you go learn how, and you won't / This is our corner of the world / Where we can come to be ignored / This is our point where we return / This is where I came from / This is what made us who we became / Where they know me, not just my name / There's not another place the same / This is where I came from / This is where I came from / Ya! / You had another thing coming if you were sleeping on us / Same old voices in my ear saying enough is enough / Well, I'm saying me and all my friends don't need you around / You had another thing coming if you were sleeping on us / Same old voices in my ear saying enough is enough / Well, I'm saying me and all my friends don't need you around / Oh oh oh, this is where I came from, I'm right back at it again / Oh oh oh, this is where I came from / Oh oh oh, this is where I came from, I'm right back at it again / Oh oh oh, this is where I came from / This is what made us who we became / Where they know me, not just my name / There's not another place the same / This is where I came from / This is where I came from / ___________________ / Name City Of Ocala / Artist A Day To Remember / Album Common Courtesy"/>
