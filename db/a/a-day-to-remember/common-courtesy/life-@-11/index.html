<title>A Day To Remember â€“ Life @ 11 | Lyrics</title>
<meta name="description" content="When the curtain falls it rolls, unwraps, reminds me / The person that I am / I'm still afraid, ashamed, of what's behind me / But you gave me the strength to stand / Sh-sh-sh-shake it off go get the things you want / I'll bottle the shame (bottle the shame) / Just sh-sh-shake it off, and no one will ever know (won't know) / I'm a slave to all these voices in my head / And I'm afraid, I'm afraid of what they've said / I'm a slave / Sometimes when no one's left to listen I'll sit and argue with myself / Say all the things I wish to tell you, without hurting someone else / Sh-sh-sh-shake it off go get the things you want / I'll bottle the shame (bottle the shame) / Just sh-sh-shake it off, and no one will ever know (won't know) / I'm a slave to all these voices in my head / And I'm afraid, I'm afraid of what they've said / I'm a slave to all these voices in my head / And I'm afraid they'll walk with me until my end / Hey you, when'd ya get so cold? (When'd ya get so cold?) / Hey you, just do what you're told, do what you're told / Hey you, you're gonna be a star / As long as you'll let us we'll make you the person that you aren't / I'm a slave to all these voices in my head / And I'm afraid, I'm afraid of what they've said / I'm a slave (I'm a slave) to all these voices in my head / And I'm afraid (I'm afraid) they'll walk with me until my end / Sh-sh-sh-shake it off go get the things you want / I'll bottle the shame (bottle the shame) / _______________ / Name Life @ 11 / Artist A Day To Remember / Album Common Courtesy"/>
