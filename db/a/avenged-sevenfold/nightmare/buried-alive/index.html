<title>Avenged Sevenfold â€“ Buried Alive | Lyrics</title>
<meta name="description" content="Take the time just to listen / When the voices screaming are much too loud / Take a look in the distance / Try and see it all / Chances are that ya might find / That we share a common discomfort now / I feel I'm walking a fine line / Tell me only if it's real / Still I'm on my way / (On and on it goes) / Vacant hope to take / Hey, I can't live in here for another day / Darkness has kept the light concealed, grim as ever / Hold onto faith as I dig another grave / Meanwhile the mice endure the wheel, real as ever / And it seems I've been buried alive / I walk the fields through the fire / Taking steps until I found solid ground / Follow dreams reaching higher / Couldn't survive the fall / Much has changed since the last time / And I feel a little less certain now / Ya know I jumped at the first sign / Tell me only if it's real / Memories seem to fade / (On and on it goes) / Wash my view away / Hey, I can't live in here for another day / Darkness has kept the light concealed, grim as ever / Hold onto faith as I dig another grave / Meanwhile the mice endure the wheel, real as ever / And I'm chained like a slave / Trapped in the dark / Slammed all the locks / Death calls my name / And it seems I've been buried alive / Take you down now, burn it all out / Throw you all around, get your fucking hands off me / What's it feel like? Took the wrong route / Watch it fall apart now you're knocking at the wrong gate / For you to pay the toll, a price for you alone / The only deal you'll find, I'll gladly take your soul / While it seems sick, sober up quick / Psycho lunatic crushing you with hands of fate / Shamed to find out, when it's too late / But you're all the same, trapped inside; Inferno awaits / Evil thoughts can hide, I'll help release the mind / I'll peel away the skin, release the dark within / This is now your life / Strike you from the light / This is now your life / Die buried alive / This is now your life (what's it feel like?) / Strike you from the light (let me take in your soul) / This is now your life (what's it feel like?) / Die buried alive (let me take in your soul) / This is now your life / Die buried alive / __________________ / Name Buried Alive / Artist Avenged Sevenfold / Album Nightmare"/>
