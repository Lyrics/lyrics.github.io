    <div class="view"><div id="lyrics">Hey kid, do I have your attention?
I know the way you've been living
Life so reckless, tragedy endless
Welcome to the family

Hey, there's something missing
Only time will alter your vision
Never in question, lethal injection
Welcome to the family

Not long ago you'd find the answers were so crystal clear
Within a day you found yourself living in constant fear
Can you look at yourself now? Can you look at yourself?
You can't win this fight

And in a way it seems there's no one to call
When our thoughts are so numb and our feelings unsure
We all have emptiness inside, we all have answers to find
But you can't win this fight

(Hey kid) I have to question
What's with the violent aggression?
Details blurry, lost him too early
Welcome to the family

Hey, why won't you listen?
Can't help the people you're missing
It's been done, a casualty rerun
Welcome to the family

I'll try and help you with the things that can't be justified
I need to warn you that there is no way to rationalize
So have you figured it out now? So have you figured it out?
You can't win this fight

And in a way it seems there's no one to call
When our thoughts are so numb and our feelings unsure
We all have emptiness inside, we all have answers to find
But you can't win this fight

Coming for you and all mankind
I've lost my mind
Psychotic, Rapid dementia
I won't be fine

I see you're a king who's been dethroned
Cast out in a world you've never known
Stand down, place your weapons by your side
It's our war, in the end we'll surely lose, but that's alright
So have you figured it out now? So have you figured it out?

And in a way it seems there's no one to call
When our thoughts are so numb and our feelings unsure
We all have emptiness inside, we all have answers to find
But you can't win this fight

Deep inside, where nothing's fine, I lost my mind
You're not invited, so step aside, I lost my...
Deep inside, where nothing's fine, I lost my mind
You're not invited, so step aside, I lost my...</div></div>
