<div><pre>House full of roses, a letter on the stairs
A tape full of messages for anyone who cares
Collage of broken words and stories full of tears
Remembering your life, 'cause we wish that you were here

Nothing is harder than to wake up all alone
Realize it's not okay, it's the end of all you've known
Time keeps passing by, but it seems I'm frozen still
Scars are left behind, but some too deep to feel

And some say this can't be real
And I've lost my power to feel tonight
We're all just victims of a crime
When all's gone and can't be regained
We can't seem to shelter the pain inside
We're all just victims of a crime

Some days you'll find me in a place I like to go
Ask questions to myself about the things I'll never know
What's left to find? 'Cause I need a little more
I need a little time, can we even up the score?

And some say this can't be real
And I've lost my power to feel tonight
We're all just victims of a crime
When all's gone and can't be regained
We can't seem to shelter the pain inside
We're all just victims of a crime, yeah, woah

Nothing lasts forever, for all good things, it's true
I'd rather trade it all while somehow saving you
It must have been the season that threw us out of line
Once I stood so tall, now I'm searching for a sign

So don't need your salvation with promises unkind
And all the speculation, save it for another time
'Cause we all need a reason, a reason just to stay
Well some just can't be bothered to stick around another day

And some say this can't be real
And I've lost my power to feel tonight
We've all been victims of a crime
When all is gone and can't be regained
We can't seem to shelter the pain inside
Ooh, we've all been victims of a crime
Victims of a crime
Living with this crime

I'm missing you
I'm missing you
I'm missing you
I'm missing you</pre></div>
