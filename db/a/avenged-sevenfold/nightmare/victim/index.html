'Cause I need a little more<br/>I need a little time, can we even up the score?</p><p>And some say this can't be real<br/>And I've lost my power to feel tonight<br/>We're all just victims of a crime<br/>When all's gone and can't be regained<br/>We can't seem to shelter the pain inside<br/>We're all just victims of a crime, yeah, woah</p><p>Nothing lasts forever, for all good things, it's true<br/>I'd rather trade it all while somehow saving you<br/>It must have been the season that threw us out of line<br/>Once I stood so tall, now I'm searching for a sign</p><p>So don't need your salvation with promises unkind<br/>And all the speculation, save it for another time<br/>'Cause we all need a reason, a reason just to stay<br/>Well some just can't be bothered to stick around another day</p><p>And some say this can't be real<br/>And I've lost my power to feel tonight<br/>We've all been victims of a crime<br/>When all is gone and can't be regained<br/>We can't seem to shelter the pain inside<br/>Ooh, we've all been victims of a crime<br/>Victims of a crime<br/>Living with this crime</p><p>I'm missing you<br/>I'm missing you<br/>I'm missing you<br/>I'm missing you</p></article></div>
