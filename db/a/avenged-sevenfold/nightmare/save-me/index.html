They all know
They all know

Sorry, did I wake your dreams? Some questions run too deep
We only, only wake up when we sleep
Led by the lunar light, trouble's all we find
Lost our way tonight (lost our way tonight)

Is it something we said?
Is it something we said to them?
Is it something we said?

(Save me) I'm trapped in a vile world
(Save me) Where the ending's all the same as every other
We're only here to die
(Save me) I'm losing my only dream
(Save me) I can use some guiding light, some place to go
You hear me, let me know

They all know
They all know

Ever since the day you left my fate's been set unknown
How many years to walk this path alone?
So much to see tonight, so why'd you close your eyes?
Why can't I shut mine?

Is it something we did?
Is it something we did to them?
Is it something we did?

(Save me) I'm trapped in a vile world
(Save me) Where the ending's all the same as every other
We're only here to die
(Save me) I'm losing my only dream
(Save me) I can use some guiding light, some place to go
If you hear me, let me know
If you hear me, let me know

Help me find my way
Said help me find my way

No pulse inside of me
Stone cold lips and heresy
All lies and to a degree
Losing who I want to be
You'll find out right now

He may be out of his mind
But someday you will find
That sanity's left us all blind
And dragged us all behind

A moment seen through those eyes
Crystal blue disguise
They say that all beauty must die
I say it just moves on

If you'd only open your mind
Then someday you will find
Insanity left us behind
And walked right through the door

I can see the pictures clear as yesterday
Pictures all my own
I can hear the voices begging you to stay
But know you're not alone

(Save me) I'm trapped in a vile world
(Save me) Where the ending's all the same as every other
We're only here to die
(Save me) I'm losing my only dream
(Save me) I can use some guiding light, some place to go
If you hear me, let me know
If you hear me, let me know

Tonight we all die young
Tonight we all die young
Tonight we all die young
Tonight we all die young
Tonight we all die young
Tonight we all die young
Tonight we all die
Tonight we all die young</pre></div>
