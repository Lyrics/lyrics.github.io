Lost the meaning of our stay
Learn to live another day
Doubt the choices that we've made
I know that we can't hide our shame
It's only in disguise

Drowning in our own debris
Fool our thoughts as though we're free
Close our eyes so we can see
The depth of all we need to be
If only in my eyes

I don't mind (read the writing on the wall)
My life grinds (tortured voices as we crawl)
Find me on my better days to lose it once again
In a way

So try and numb me while you can
And take the time to understand
As long as I can touch your face
You know I'll never leave this place
If only in my mind

I don't mind (read the writing on the wall)
My life grinds (tortured voices as we crawl)
Find me on my better days to lose it once again
But I seem to find no better ways to consciously pretend

Silence all I want to say
With tendencies to run away
I'll run away with you tonight
Launder all my sins away
And just like that mistakes are made, you know
Tonight the world dies

I don't mind (read the writing on the wall)
My life grinds (tortured voices as we crawl)
Find me on my better days to lose it once again
But I seem to find no better ways to consciously pretend
