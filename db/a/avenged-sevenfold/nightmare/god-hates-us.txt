Total nightmare
Total nightmare

You wanna hear my side?
You need to drown to know
With all the times it hurt me to fuck you
I built a wall with your blood to show

God save us
God save us all
God hates us
God hates us all

Total nightmare
Total nightmare

Nothing to heal, no one to break
Pills had a role now there's nothing to take
Nothing to trust, no one to fake
You'll find out sooner that it's best if we just know our place

My infiltrated mind, my lacerated soul
It took me years, create me, control you
I left myself for an idea I stole

God save us
God save us all
God hates us
God hates us all

Total nightmare
Total nightmare

Liar, rape, kill
Love, hate, fear

You better take your time
(Liar, rape, kill)
You better take it slow
'Cause when you see the one
(Love, hate, fear)
There's nothing left to show

Total nightmare
Total nightmare
