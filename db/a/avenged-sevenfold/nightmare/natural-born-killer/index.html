<title>Avenged Sevenfold â€“ Natural Born Killer | Lyrics</title>
<meta name="description" content="One snap for the dying / One click to end the day / Another story with a mangled scene / It couldn't happen any other way / You wanna talk about it? / I'm begging you to walk in my shoes anytime / Watch the clock till you unwind / You wanna cry about it / It's making me consider that I lost my mind / The way I see you must be blind / So this is the world you left behind / This is the guilt that consumes you / So die alone / This is the one thing that I won't do / So say your prayers / 'Cause I ain't leaving here without you / Can't bribe me with money / Can't shower me with shame / Another killer from a broken home / Until you cover me with manic fame / You wanna know about it? / But I'ma be fucking with you every time / Story broke and you're behind / And when you ask about it / You can rest assured I'll give you my best side / Seems we all have friends to find / So this is the hate I've been born to / Full of the tales of the untrue / So die alone / This is the one thing that I won't do / So say your prayers / 'Cause I ain't leaving here without you / And I'm waiting, waiting for the days to slowly pass me by / And all the promises I'll find / No hesitating, you pull the trigger now your story's left behind / I know you wanna see me fry / Like my soul you won't survive / So die alone / This is the one thing that I won't do / So say your prayers / 'Cause I ain't leaving here without you / To die unknown / Would crush the fish lens we all see through / To kill the glare / Expose the ugliness we hold true / _________________________ / Name Natural Born Killer / Artist Avenged Sevenfold / Album Nightmare"/>
