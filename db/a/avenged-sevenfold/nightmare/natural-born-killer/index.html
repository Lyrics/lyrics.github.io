    <div class="view"><div id="lyrics">One snap for the dying
One click to end the day
Another story with a mangled scene
It couldn't happen any other way

You wanna talk about it?
I'm begging you to walk in my shoes anytime
Watch the clock till you unwind
You wanna cry about it
It's making me consider that I lost my mind
The way I see you must be blind

So this is the world you left behind
This is the guilt that consumes you

So die alone
This is the one thing that I won't do
So say your prayers
'Cause I ain't leaving here without you

Can't bribe me with money
Can't shower me with shame
Another killer from a broken home
Until you cover me with manic fame

You wanna know about it?
But I'ma be fucking with you every time
Story broke and you're behind
And when you ask about it
You can rest assured I'll give you my best side
Seems we all have friends to find

So this is the hate I've been born to
Full of the tales of the untrue

So die alone
This is the one thing that I won't do
So say your prayers
'Cause I ain't leaving here without you

And I'm waiting, waiting for the days to slowly pass me by
And all the promises I'll find
No hesitating, you pull the trigger now your story's left behind
I know you wanna see me fry
Like my soul you won't survive

So die alone
This is the one thing that I won't do
So say your prayers
'Cause I ain't leaving here without you

To die unknown
Would crush the fish lens we all see through
To kill the glare
Expose the ugliness we hold true</div></div>
