Centuries pass and still the same
War in our blood
Some things never change
Fighting for land and personal gain
Better your life, justify our pain
The end is knocking
The end is knocking

We've all been lost
For most of this life
(Lost for most of this life)
Everywhere we turn
More hatred surrounds us
And I know that most of
Us just ain't right
(Most of us just ain't right)
Following the wrong steps
Being led by pride

How many lives will we take?
How many hearts, destined to break?
Nowhere to run, can't escape
Full of ourselves, tied to our fate
The end is knocking
The end is knocking
Yeah

We've all been lost
For most of this life
(Lost for most of this life)
Everywhere we turn
More hatred surrounds us
And I know that most of
Us just ain't right
(Most of us just ain't right)
Following the wrong steps
Being led by pride

With peace of mind so hard to find
We're dwelling on the drastic signs
Another way to numb our mind
And as you close your eyes tonight
And pray for a better life
You'll see it flying helplessly away

We've all been lost
For most of this life
(Lost for most of this life)
Everywhere we turn
More hatred surrounds us
And I know that most of
Us just ain't right
(Most of us just ain't right)
Following the wrong steps
Being led by pride
