Before the story begins, is it such a sin
For me to take what's mine until the end of time?
We were more than friends before the story ends
And I will take what's mine, create what God would never design

Our love had been so strong for far too long
I was weak with fear that something would go wrong
Before the possibilities came true
I took all possibility from you.

I almost laughed myself to tears
Conjuring her deepest fears
(Come here, you fucking bitch)

Must have stabbed her fifty fucking times
I can't believe it
Ripped her heart out right before her eyes
Eyes over easy
Eat it, eat it, eat it

She was never this good in bed even when she was sleeping
Now she's just so perfect I've never been quite so fucking deep in

It goes on and on and on
And I can keep you looking young and preserved forever
With a fountain to spray on your youth whenever

Cause I really always knew that my little crime would be cold
That's why I got a heater for your thighs
And I know, I know it's not your time, but bye-bye
And a word to the wise when the fire dies
You think it's over but it's just begun
But baby don't cry.

You had my heart, at least for the most part
Cause everybody's gotta die sometime
We fell apart, let's make a new start
Cause everybody's gotta die sometime, yeah, yeah
But baby don't cry

Possibilities I'd never considered
Are occurring the likes of which I'd never heard
Now an angry soul comes back from beyond the grave
To repossess a body with which I misbehaved

Smiling right from ear to ear
Almost laughed herself to tears

Must have stabbed him fifty fucking times
I can't believe it
Ripped his heart out right before his eyes
Eyes over easy
Eat it, eat it, eat it
(Eat the shit out of him)

Now that it's done, I realize the error of my ways
I must return back to apologize from somewhere far beyond the grave

I gotta make up for what I've done
Cause I was all up in a piece of Heaven
While you burned in hell, no peace forever

Cause I really always knew that my little crime would be cold
That's why I got a heater for your thighs
And I know, I know it's not your time, but bye-bye
And a word to the wise when the fire dies
You think it's over but it's just begun
But baby don't cry.

You had my heart, at least for the most part
Cause everybody's gotta die sometime
We fell apart, let's make a new start
Cause everybody's gotta die sometime, yeah, yeah
But baby don't cry

(What will you do?)
I will suffer for so long
(Not long enough)
To make it up to you
(I pray to God that you do)
I'll do whatever you want me to do.
(Well then I'll grant you one chance)
And if it's not enough
(If it's not enough, if it's not enough)
If it's not enough
(Not enough)
Try again
(Try again)
And again
(And again)
Over and over again

Coming back, coming back
We'll live forever, live forever
Let's have wedding, have a wedding
Let's start the killing, start the killing

Do you take this man in death for the rest of your unnatural life?
Yes, I do

Do you take this woman in death for the rest of your unnatural life?
I do
I now pronounce you..

Cause I really always knew that my little crime would be cold
That's why I got a heater for your thighs
And I know, I know it's not your time, but bye-bye
And a word to the wise when the fire dies
You think it's over but it's just begun
But baby don't cry.

You had my heart, at least for the most part
Cause everybody's gotta die sometime
We fell apart, let's make a new start
Cause everybody's gotta die sometime, yeah, yeah
But baby don't cry
