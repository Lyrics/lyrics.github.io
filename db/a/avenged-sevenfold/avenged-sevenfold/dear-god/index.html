<title>Avenged Sevenfold â€“ Dear God | Lyrics</title>
<meta name="description" content="A lonely road, crossed another cold state line / Miles away from those I love, purpose hard to find / While I recall all the words you spoke to me / Can't help but wish that I was there / Back where I'd love to be, oh yeah / Dear God the only thing I ask of you / Is to hold her when I'm not around / When I'm much too far away / We all need that person / Who can be true to you / But I left her when I found her / And now I wish I'd stayed / 'Cause I'm lonely and I'm tired / I'm missing you again oh no / Once again / There's nothing here for me / On this barren road / There's no one here / While the city sleeps / And all the shops are closed / Can't help but think of / The times I've had with you / Pictures and some memories / Will have to help me through / Oh yeah / Dear God the only thing I ask of you / Is to hold her when I'm not around / When I'm much too far away / We all need that person / Who can be true to you / I left her when I found her / And now I wish I'd stayed / 'Cause I'm lonely and I'm tired / I'm missing you again oh no / Once again / Some search, never finding a way / Before long, they waste away / I found you, something told me to stay / I gave in, to selfish ways / And how I miss someone to hold / When hope begins to fade. / A lonely road, crossed another cold state line / Miles away from those I love, purpose hard to find / Dear God the only thing I ask of you / Is to hold her when I'm not around / When I'm much too far away / We all need that person / Who can be true to you / I left her when I found her / And now I wish I'd stayed / 'Cause I'm lonely and I'm tired / I'm missing you again oh no / Once again / -Solos- / ______________ / Name Dear God / Artist Avenged Sevenfold / Album Avenged Sevenfold"/>
