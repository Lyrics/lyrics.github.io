<title>Arcane Roots â€“ Triptych | Lyrics</title>
<meta name="description" content="So now that you know it's right / Can you see it from the otherside / Do you see there is no wrong or right / Can you leave them in another tide / There will be no other promise / I can now give to show the other slight / So the ground will make your love light / Hold the sleepers to the morning light / But as the doctors came around / No one dared to make a sound / The architecture / Gave up all the sects and it made no sense at all / So when the arcs had run aground / And the visitors allowed / We gave conjecture / One by one and it made no sense at all / So do you lead them to the light / Tie the noose or settle sides / Can you bring them to another life / Can you breathe into a lovers lie / So while we sink into a second sign / Fold the leaves into a dotted line / You will see the limbs of love and pride / Follow suit without a single sigh / So as the doctors came around / No one dared to make a sound / The architecture / Gave up all the sects and it made no sense at all / So when the arcs had run aground / And the visitors allowed / We gave conjecture / One by one and it made no sense at all / It made no sense at all / It made no sense at all / One by one we told ourselves / That they would keep the promises that we made / We made your sons and daughters / They will be nothing like us / I'll never tell you again / So pay your lips to be the seconds I count in over / And breathe life into cold, cold hearts / We will not tell you again, / We will not falter again / So as the doctors came around / No one dared to make a sound / The architecture / Gave up all the sects and it made no sense at all / So when the arcs had run aground / And the visitors allowed / We gave conjecture / One by one and it made no sense at all / It made no sense at all / It made no sense at all / I'll never know what leaves your heart / When I will fall, it's to your side / I'll never know what leaves your heart / When I will fall, it's to your side / ______________ / Name Triptych / Artist Arcane Roots / Album Blood & Chemistry"/>
