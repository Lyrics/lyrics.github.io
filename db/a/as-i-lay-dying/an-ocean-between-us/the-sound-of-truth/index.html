    <div class="view"><div id="lyrics">Yeah

We have all heard what we wanted to hear
Truth that sounds right to our ears

We have all heard what we wanted to hear
Truth that sounds right to our ears

But what wisdom is there within us
To live based on the feeling of our hearts?
How many times has instinct let us down
Never to be thought through
Never to be questioned

No

Say what you really mean
When your ambition calls you
Calls you
For what use is there in praying
If you will only hear what you want to hear?

We have all heard what we wanted to hear
Truth that sounds right to our ears

Yeah

We speak of fighting to resist this world
But what about the battle within us? (Yeah)
If we have chosen to live against the grain
Then why are we all facing the same way?

There is no difference between us and them
If we all blindly seek truth from sentiments

We have all heard what we wanted to hear
Truth that sounds right to our ears

We have all heard what we wanted to hear
Truth that sounds right to our ears

We have all heard what we wanted to hear
Truth that sounds right to our ears</div></div>
