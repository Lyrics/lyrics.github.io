<title>As I Lay Dying â€“ The Sound Of Truth | Lyrics</title>
<meta name="description" content="Yeah / We have all heard what we wanted to hear / Truth that sounds right to our ears / We have all heard what we wanted to hear / Truth that sounds right to our ears / But what wisdom is there within us / To live based on the feeling of our hearts? / How many times has instinct let us down / Never to be thought through / Never to be questioned / No / Say what you really mean / When your ambition calls you / Calls you / For what use is there in praying / If you will only hear what you want to hear? / We have all heard what we wanted to hear / Truth that sounds right to our ears / Yeah / We speak of fighting to resist this world / But what about the battle within us? (Yeah) / If we have chosen to live against the grain / Then why are we all facing the same way? / There is no difference between us and them / If we all blindly seek truth from sentiments / We have all heard what we wanted to hear / Truth that sounds right to our ears / We have all heard what we wanted to hear / Truth that sounds right to our ears / We have all heard what we wanted to hear / Truth that sounds right to our ears / ________________________ / Name The Sound Of Truth / Artist As I Lay Dying / Album An Ocean Between Us"/>
