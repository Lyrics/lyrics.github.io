I see them coming
With shrouds to bury us all
Before we were born they shaped our lives
Leading us into an unmarked grave
In moments life could end
So I will speak while I can

This is my chance
My time to stand

We may fail alone but that is better
Than dying with them only to be forgotten
I for one would rather suffer now
Than leave this life without passion

This is our chance
Our time to stand
