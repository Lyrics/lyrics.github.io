    <div class="view"><pre>I never wanted and I never cared before.

I never wanted and I never cared before.
Take it back, this is a new day.
I never wanted and I never cared before.
Take it back, this is.

How I long to regress
To the days before I took upon myself
: The obsessions of this world
: A day of innocence equating beauty
: And tomorrow may fall
: And today is already gone
Tomorrow may fall
Today is already gone.

Take it back, this is a new day.
I never wanted, this is a new day.
And I never cared before.
I never wanted,
I never wanted,
And I never cared before.

I've grown tired of chasing
Convinced I was in need
And now the years I've spent
Only a slave to this.
Tomorrow may fall
And today is already gone,
I will no longer adore
These things that will never satisfy me.

I've seen my world change
And then go back to where it came.

In this vicious circle we are all brought back to life only to die.
In this vicious circle we are all brought back to life only to die.
To die.

: In this vicious circle
: We are all
: Brought back to life
: Only to die.
: In this vicious circle
: We are all
: Brought back to life
: Only to die.

I've seen my world change
And then go back to where it came.</pre></div>
