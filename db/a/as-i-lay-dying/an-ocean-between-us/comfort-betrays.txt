Rah!
You sat and watched
As I nearly destroyed myself
Never had I felt so betrayed
That you would sacrifice my life
For no more than your comfort.

And now your love means nothing, nothing to me,
Your love means nothing to me.
Nothing to me.

You are a coward the antithesis of a friend,
Take action before there is no one left to defend.

For I would have stood by you, x2
Right to the gates of hell.

For I would have stood by you,
Right to the gates of hell. x2
