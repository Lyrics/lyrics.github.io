<title>As I Lay Dying â€“ This Is Who We Are | Lyrics</title>
<meta name="description" content="Now this is who we are / I am no one's / I am no one's hero / I am no one / For we are not the giant men / That some may think / YOU are faithful when we are not / So I'd like to tell this story / The way it is meant to be / Without the burden that's in our hearts / None of us would have ever found YOU / For YOU are faithful when we are not / YOU began a work / That only YOU can complete / Now this is who we are / I'll never know the answers / And I'll always wonder why / Now this is who we are / I'll never know the answers / And I'll always wonder why / Why we are given grace we'll never deserve / And a second chance that we will never earn / For there is nothing I can do to save myself / For there is nothing I can do / Now this is who we are / I'll never know the answers / And I'll always wonder why / Now this is who we are / I'll never know the answers / And I'll always wonder why / And I'll always / And I'll always wonder why / Now this is who we are / I'll never know the answers / And I'll always wonder why / But YOU have let me start again / I'd rather be called weak / Than die thinking I was strong / ________________________ / Name This Is Who We Are / Artist As I Lay Dying / Album An Ocean Between Us"/>
