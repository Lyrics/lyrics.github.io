I can only imagine that wrath is being held out
So there will be time for us to be redeemed
But surely wrath is not being held out
So that we may redeem ourselves
For I've seen the madness
Of those who died trying
But is regret only a word that the living possess?
I long to see their faces
Regardless of the decay
For in the eyes of the deceased...

We would see hope in our last day
Inside this dying world
For there is still beauty
Inside this dying world

For what good is there holding off wrath
If we are determined
To bring wrath upon ourselves
