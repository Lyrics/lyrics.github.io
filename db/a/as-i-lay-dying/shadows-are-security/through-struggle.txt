only through struggle have i found rest
with a piece of me taken away
i begin to understand
hollow out this machine like chest
with its gears that turn to make me feel
and assembled thoughts that fade away

only through struggle have i found rest
only through struggle have i found rest

remove from me
this deception that i called love
that i called love

with its gears that turn to make me feel
and assembled thoughts that fade away

remove from me
this deception that i called love
that i called love

only through struggle have i found rest
with a piece of me taken away
i begin to understand
i begin to understand
