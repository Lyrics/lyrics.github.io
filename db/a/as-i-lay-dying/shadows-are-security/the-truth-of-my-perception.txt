While shutters enclose the boundaries of my heart.
I hold my breath till the steady beating is shut out.
In silence I wait for what is real.
For I know the truth of my perception.
Nothing in life matters more, more than You.
Nothing more, more than You.
When first feelings fade,
I will still be here.

I hold my breath till the steady beating is shut out.
For I know the truth of my perception.
Nothing in life matters more, more than You.
Nothing more, more than You.
When first feelings fade,
I will still be here.
