<title>As I Lay Dying â€“ Repeating Yesterday | Lyrics</title>
<meta name="description" content="This is what I am, this is what I have become: / Repeating yesterday / Drain me of my very essence to form again what lasts / This is what I am, this is what I have become: / Repeating yesterday / Drain me of my very essence / This is what I am, this is what I have become / What is love, what is love / What is love without sacrifice? / My tears hold no weight / If my commitments is only failure, is only failure / Repeat yesterday / Each day I am born, I am born again to be, again to be / A child, a child in the eyes of love / Repeating yesterday, repeating / Drain me of my very essence to form, to form again / To form, to form again what lasts / This is what I am, this is what I have become / What is love, what is love / What is love without...? / _________________________ / Name Repeating Yesterday / Artist As I Lay Dying / Album Shadows Are Security"/>
