i've watched them build
upon these empty hearts
false hopes of lossless paradise
gathering together
the dead hearts beat as one
stillborn comfort feeding lies
through answers of self denial
divided between a dissolute self
and the sorrow of sincere devotion
what is it that you find peace in now
where is your hope in this dark night
