That night I never came home, wandering souls captured my thoughts
Emptiness filled my mind, urgency spoke her lies
In the confines of these grey walls I watched them move together
Taking me places I cannot remember, remember
We have been poured out into a loveless bride

How quickly I forget that this is meaningless
How quickly I forget that this is meaningless

In a world passing through my fingers I still chase the wind

How quickly I forget that this is meaningless
How quickly I forget that this is meaningless

What have I learned from yesterday?
What have I learned from yesterday?
