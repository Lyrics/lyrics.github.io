This is what I am, this is what I have become:
Repeating yesterday
Drain me of my very essence to form again what lasts
This is what I am, this is what I have become:
Repeating yesterday
Drain me of my very essence

This is what I am, this is what I have become
What is love, what is love
What is love without sacrifice?
My tears hold no weight
If my commitments is only failure, is only failure

Repeat yesterday

Each day I am born, I am born again to be, again to be
A child, a child in the eyes of love
Repeating yesterday, repeating
Drain me of my very essence to form, to form again
To form, to form again what lasts

This is what I am, this is what I have become
What is love, what is love
What is love without...?
