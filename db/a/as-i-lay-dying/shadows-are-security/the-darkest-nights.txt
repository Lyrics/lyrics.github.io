For so long I have felt alone
Content to live with unrest
Longing faded into countless
Nights that buried my weary heart

But you brought an end to this dead hour
And meaning to a calloused life
Held in your arms but too far from my heart
Held in your arms but too far from my heart

These thoughts will carry me
Through the darkest nights
While your eyes rest in
These thoughts will carry me
Through the darkest nights
While your eyes rest in
Mine

I remember the way you looked
At me and the way you drew me close
With one deep sigh scattering
Pieces of my restless mind
Forgetting all that we have left behind

These thoughts will carry me
Through the darkest nights
While your eyes rest in
These thoughts will carry me
Through the darkest nights
While your eyes rest in
These thoughts will carry me
Through the darkest nights
While your eyes rest in
These thoughts will carry me
Through the darkest nights
While your eyes rest in...
