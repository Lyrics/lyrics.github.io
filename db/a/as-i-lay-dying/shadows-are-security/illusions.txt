how could i ever go back?
back to the life where i lived amongst the dead
those who have forgotten how to feel
and become slaves to memory and wishful thinking
but your love has set me free
as you awaken every star that has been sleeping in the constellation of my soul
how could i go back to live amongst the dead
those who imprisoned beauty
i never want to leave your arms
so i wait in hope for your embrace
illusions of what i thought was love
now i have clear sight to see that i have left nothing behind
