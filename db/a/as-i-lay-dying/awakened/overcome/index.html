<title>As I Lay Dying â€“ Overcome | Lyrics</title>
<meta name="description" content="All these moments of pain / Must add up to something / Our bodies have been trained to keep it all in / But our hearts still hold on / Some say to release it, forget about your past / Instead we count the cost, it's part of us / That doesn't mean that we cannot move on / It's just a memory of what we once were / No matter what it is we've faced / It's now part of us (part of us) / We can overcome / Why rid of fuel that can make us stronger / When properly put behind us? (put behind us) / And in the same way that / Everything good in life can be taken away / So can all this pain / No matter what it is we've faced / It's now part of us (part of us) / No matter what we've faced in this life / We can overcome / Trying to forget is a burden we can never bear / When facing trials openly / There's nothing left to hide / New paths of strength come alive / We can overcome / No matter what it is we've faced / It's now part of us (part of us) / No matter what we've faced in this life / We can overcome / ______________ / Name Overcome / Artist As I Lay Dying / Album Awakened"/>
