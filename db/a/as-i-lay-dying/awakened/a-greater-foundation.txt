Reality no longer battles perception.
This letter's written to no one.

Sincere,
I sought your truth and divine purpose
through myths of revelation.
Guidance all wrapped up in a paper box,
supported only so long
as my mind was the enemy.
I could not in conscience hold on.

As we face distress
we must not lose heart.
Stand fast and press on,
Triumph awaits.
As we face distress
we must not lose heart.
Stand fast and press on,
Triumph awaits us.

The powerful constant that I had once leaned on is no longer there.
(No longer)
You call this shameful disbelief,
a process like losing my closest friend.

As we face distress
we must not lose heart.
Stand fast and press on,
Triumph awaits.
As we face distress
we must not lose heart.
Stand fast and press on,
Triumph awaits us.

Sometimes we have to watch our whole lives fall apart,
Before we can rebuild them again,
A Greater Foundation.
We watch our whole lives.
Sometimes we have to watch our whole lives
... fall apart,
Before we can rebuild them again,(rebuild them again)
A Greater Foundation.

I wish there was another way,
but no amount of devotion can fix this.

Triumph awaits.
Triumph awaits.
Triumph awaits.
Triumph awaits.
Triumph awaits.

Sometimes we have to watch our whole lives fall apart,
Before we can rebuild them again,
A Greater Foundation.
We watch our whole lives.
Fall apart.
Sometimes we have to watch our whole lives.
Rebuild them again.
Before we can rebuild them again,
A Greater Foundation
