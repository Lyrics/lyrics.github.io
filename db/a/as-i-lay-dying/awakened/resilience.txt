Your resilience inspires me
Facing tragedies I will never face
Your presence is humbling
To think of all that you have overcome
It took such little pain
For our lives to coalesce
Finding what I could've found in no one else

You bring me through the darkness of myself
And show me that frailty can be turned to strength

Suffering
Persistence
Such sorrow
Yet resilience

From the outside I've deceived the world
With false bravery
Yet you have taught me so much more
Much more than I can ever teach
And someday you might
Need someone to lean on

I can only hope that I'll have gained the courage
To be there for you in whatever you face
You bring me trough (you bring me through)
The darkness of myself
And show me that frailty (can be turned)
Can be turned to strength

Suffering
Persistence
Such sorrow
Yet resilience

At times I'm carried on the shoulders of a child
I find power in your firm fallibility
My source of hope is seeing that weak prevail
And I'm better able to live because you're alive
I could not imagine a world without you
Where I looked you in the eyes and left you to die

Suffering
Persistence
Such sorrow
Yet resilience
