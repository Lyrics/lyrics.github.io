Can you understand my meaning
Hidden in the roses, around my eyes
I want you to know how much it means to have you
In my life
Your love brings me close again
In this instance this single moment when our worlds collide
The wire of eternity twists around us
I can feel this river rising, moving up my back
Some things never change, some things never go away
I could never forget you, and I will never be the same
