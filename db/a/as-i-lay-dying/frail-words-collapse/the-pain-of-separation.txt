How can I bear this any longer
Arms stretched out only to hold separation
Take me away
I'm dying inside, emptied before you
Take me into your arms
I will fight until the day when I will see
Sight given to these blind eyes
When will I be taken from this life?
Take what is yours
You deserve more than my life
