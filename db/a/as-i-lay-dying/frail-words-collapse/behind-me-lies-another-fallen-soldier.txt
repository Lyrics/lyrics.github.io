I want to bring You all that is in my heart
I want to give You my everything
But I've failed You so many times
How can I stand here before You
When I begin to steal what only belongs to You
I am able to bring You nothing that isn't already Yours
I am so ashamed of what I ever called my own
Take what I have, take these broken remains
What can I give to You that You don't already deserve
You laid down Your life when I refused to give mine
