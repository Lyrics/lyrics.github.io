<title>As I Lay Dying â€“ Anger and Apathy | Lyrics</title>
<meta name="description" content="I've tried to find reconciliation behind the walls of those whose hatred burns. / For I find it easier to reach someone who still feels, / Than to make amends with passionless apathy. / Where all lines are the same a portrait cannot be made. / I need to burn inside. I need to know that you are alive. / I need to know that feelings of discontent are stronger / Than indifference for those too weak to stand. / Like a colorless sky over a sea of nothingness, / Hatred faces its enemies while apathy strikes furtively. / I need to burn inside. I need to know that you are alive. / I need to know that feelings of discontent are stronger / Than indifference for those too weak to stand. / I need to know that feelings of discontent are stronger / Than indifference for those too weak to stand... / Until our anger burns against injustice, we will create / The faceless by dismissing those forced to concede. / Many of us have turned off the light outside, erasing what exists beyond our front door. / And for you I find it harder to reach common ground than my most glaring opposition. / But what about those who've lost the luxury of choice? / ...striving for identity, buried by our lack of interest, souls marked as mere history. / How much grievance will it take to awaken us? / I need to know that feelings of discontent are stronger / Than indifference for those too weak to stand. / I need to know that feelings of discontent are stronger / Than indifference for those too weak to stand... / How much grievance will it take to awaken us from the comfort of our homes? / ...the comfort of our oversized graves. / I've tried to find reconciliation... I've tried to find reconciliation... / ______________________ / Name Anger and Apathy / Artist As I Lay Dying / Album The Powerless Rise"/>
