<title>As I Lay Dying â€“ The Plague | Lyrics</title>
<meta name="description" content="Just like the spread of disease.... Ya... Ya... / Debt and guilt or guilt and decree, the masters that we please. / Yet if we seek help for infirmities, we are made twice the sons of hell as before. / Reach out your hand. Reach out your hand, only to be plagued by disease. / Reach out your hand. Reach out your hand, only to be plagued by disease. / While religion tries to blame what we cannot see, I accept that part of the problem is me. / It was never a sacred mandate to accept conformity, / Through select revelations that we choose to believe. / Another blind guide replacing divine eyes. / Familiarity is the great deception, disguised by authority, sealing out subversion. / Whitewashed tombs have hidden the truth, for we unknowingly worship icons of ordinary life. / Reach out your hand to find forgiveness, only to be plagued by disease. / The horrors of beliefs and customs, camouflaged by commonality. / Reach out your hand, reach out your hand. Reach out your hand, reach out your hand. / I still believe that there is hope for us, but I believe we must look outside / The sanctuaries of oppression that have brought our world so much pain.... / Yeah.... / Another blind guide replacing divine eyes (eyes). / Whitewashed tombs (whitewashed tombs) have hidden the truth. / Reach out your hand to find forgiveness, only to be plagued by disease (plagued by disease). / Reach out your hand to find forgiveness (reach out your hand), only to be plagued by disease. / Reach out your hand, reach out your hand. / ________________ / Name The Plague / Artist As I Lay Dying / Album The Powerless Rise"/>
