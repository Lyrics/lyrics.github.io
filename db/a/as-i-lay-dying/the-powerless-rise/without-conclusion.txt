Yeah....

If we chase acclaim in search for...search for stature,
Then our status becomes a vacuum draining. Opulence is a myth for there is no final rest.
Change in circumstance only delays. The inescapable fact that we are downcast.

In looking to the end we've lost sight of where to begin.

Hope lies not in reaching...reaching the end, if the journey itself is enough to bring fulfillment.

Without conclusion this song will end. Without conclusion there is no final rest.
Without conclusion... Shred...

We are void of purpose before we start.
For in chasing our destination the present state is sacrificed... sacrificed.
In looking to... In looking to the end we have lost sight of where to begin.
We've lost... We have lost sight of where to begin.

Without conclusion this song will end. Without conclusion there is no final rest...
Without conclusion this song will end. Without conclusion there is no final rest...
Without conclusion this song will end. Without conclusion...
