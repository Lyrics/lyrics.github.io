Like the haunting chants and prayers to which I've never listened
thou shalt no longer live in chains or ever be imprisoned.
Ease my always throbbing heart, I shall no longer falter
as pupae to imagines all images must alter.

Let thy glory shine on me, disperse my obfuscation,
hide thy essence in myself, I need assimilation.
Stream thyself into my soul and flood it with thy yearning,
pour thy soul into my shell, erase my restless burning.

I hear voices of a stranger.
I hear voices of a stranger.
I hear voices of a stranger.
I hear voices in my head, echoing.

I hear voices of a stranger.
I hear voices of a stranger.
I hear voices of a stranger.
I hear voices in my head, echoing.
