You shouldn't have stayed<br/>You'd always said "There's so much love in you"<br/>I can't believe that you can't see that</p><p>You loved me for all the wrong reasons<br/>I'm not the same as I used to be<br/>There's nothing but pain left here I know<br/>What's killing me is that I'm killing you</p><p>Do you remember the beginning? Heartbeats one and the same?<br/>Living smitten in Texas, burning bright as a flame<br/>So young and in love, no care what anyone said<br/>'Til my soul grew cold and my heart turned dead</p><p>What went so wrong with me? Why did I break this?<br/>Why was I so blind and fucking dumb to see<br/>That we were perfect 'til I turned around<br/>And gave in to debauchery<br/>This is your chance to escape this<br/>My goodbye with a last kiss<br/>'Cause I know deep down you know that</p><p>You loved me for all the wrong reasons<br/>I'm not the same as I used to be<br/>There's nothing but pain left here I know<br/>What's killing me is that I'm killing you</p><p>You loved me for all the wrong reasons<br/>I'm not the same as I used to be<br/>There's nothing but pain left here I know<br/>What's killing me is that I'm killing you</p></article></div>
