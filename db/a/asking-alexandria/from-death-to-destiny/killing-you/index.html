<title>Asking Alexandria â€“ Killing You | Lyrics</title>
<meta name="description" content="You loved me for all the wrong reasons / There's nothing but pain left here I know / What's killing me is that I'm killing you / Three years of torment and torturous love / Stained with tears and mistrust, enough is enough / I can't hold you any longer in this hell I'm in / 'Cause your heart is too weak for me to break it again / All the mistakes that I've made / You forgave, what the fuck? You shouldn't have stayed / You'd always said "There's so much love in you" / I can't believe that you can't see that / You loved me for all the wrong reasons / I'm not the same as I used to be / There's nothing but pain left here I know / What's killing me is that I'm killing you / Do you remember the beginning? Heartbeats one and the same? / Living smitten in Texas, burning bright as a flame / So young and in love, no care what anyone said / 'Til my soul grew cold and my heart turned dead / What went so wrong with me? Why did I break this? / Why was I so blind and fucking dumb to see / That we were perfect 'til I turned around / And gave in to debauchery / This is your chance to escape this / My goodbye with a last kiss / 'Cause I know deep down you know that / You loved me for all the wrong reasons / I'm not the same as I used to be / There's nothing but pain left here I know / What's killing me is that I'm killing you / You loved me for all the wrong reasons / I'm not the same as I used to be / There's nothing but pain left here I know / What's killing me is that I'm killing you / _________________ / Name Killing You / Artist Asking Alexandria / Album From Death To Destiny"/>
