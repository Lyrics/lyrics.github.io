You're fucking crazy if you think that I'll ever change
I am I, I am me, I'll never change my ways
I'm a monster and that's how I'll stay
Condemned to predetermined damnation for eternity
Damnation for eternity

I don't want you to cry, I don't even want you to care
Don't you dare pray for me, no
There's things I bury inside to keep away from the light
Don't you dare pray for me

I've been so far gone for so long
And I can't keep my head up out the bottle
Holy fuck, why do I bother?
I'm never gonna get any better
I've waited so long to declare
"I don't give a fuck if I die today"
Holy shit, I've lost my mind
Reality is starting to unwind

Don't pray for me

I don't want you to cry, I don't even want you to care
Don't you dare pray for me, no
There's things I bury inside to keep away from the light
Don't you dare pray for me

I don't want you to cry, I don't even want you to care
Don't you dare pray for me, no
There's things I bury inside to keep away from the light
Don't you dare pray for me
