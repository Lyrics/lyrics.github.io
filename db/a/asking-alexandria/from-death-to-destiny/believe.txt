You've got to believe
You've got to believe

We've tried it all, tried everything but giving in
I refuse to throw all that we have away
I still recall, I still remember better days
The endless search goes on to light the fire again

We can make a difference here
Just close your eyes and take this hand my dear
Just hold your breath and let me dry your tears
All you've got to do is believe

All you've got to do is believe, believe
All you've got to do is believe

The life you can't understand you just have to reach out and grab it
Our future's out there somewhere waiting to come home

We can make a difference here
Just close your eyes and take this hand my dear
Just hold your breath and let me dry your tears
All you've got to do is believe

You don't have to cry another tear for me
I'll be there 'til the day we die hand in hand
Will you believe in me? Will you believe in me? Will you believe?

We can make a difference here
Just close your eyes and take this hand my dear
Just hold your breath and let me dry your tears
All you've got to do is believe

We can make a difference here
Just close your eyes and take this hand my dear
Just hold your breath and let me dry your tears
All you've got to do is believe
