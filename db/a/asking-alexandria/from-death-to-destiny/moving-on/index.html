    <div class="view"><pre>A boy of anguish now he's a man of soul
Traded in his misery for the lonely life of the road
The years were cruel to him, no he won't let them go
Lays awake try'na find the man inside to pack his bags and escape this world

I've never been so torn up in all of my life
I should have seen this coming
I've never felt so hopeless than I do tonight
I don't wanna do this anymore, I'm moving on

He wanted to change the world, to make it all worthwhile
So he put his pen to paper and poured out everything inside
His red eyes tearing up at the man that he'd became
Slowly but surely on the fast track to falling into his grave

I've never been so torn up in all of my life
I should have seen this coming
I've never felt so hopeless than I do tonight
I don't wanna do this anymore, I'm moving on

I can't believe I've come so far in such short time
And I'm still fighting on my own
If I stop to catch my breath I might never breathe again
So just know this
I've never been so torn up in all of my life
I can't believe I let myself break down

I've never been so torn up in all of my life
I should have seen this coming
I've never felt so hopeless than I do tonight
I don't wanna do this anymore

I've never been so torn up in all of my life
I should have seen this coming
I've never felt so hopeless than I do tonight
I don't wanna do this anymore, I'm moving on

A boy of anguish now he's a man of soul
Traded in his misery for the lonely life of the road</pre></div>
