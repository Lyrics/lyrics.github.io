<title>Asking Alexandria â€“ Run Free | Lyrics</title>
<meta name="description" content="This world's yours for the taking / This world's yours for the taking / This world's yours for the taking / Run free / Run free and wild, lose your mind, escape your inhibitions / Taste the wind, let your hair down and throw your hands up / Go, go, go, let go, forget the consequences / Go, go, go, let go, running free / Open your heart, open your mind to a new world, to a new world / Spread out your wings and learn to fly to a new world, to a new world / This world's yours for the taking / This world's yours for the taking / This world's yours for the taking / Run free / Run free and wild, lose your mind, this world's yours for the taking / Open wide, scream it loud "This is my life" / Go, go, go, let go, forget what came before / Go, go, go, let go, running free / Open your heart, open your mind to a new world, to a new world / Spread out your wings and learn to fly to a new world, to a new world / Close your eyes and pray for something bigger than this world has to give / Make it worth your time when you move on to whatever the hell is next / Know that you went in the end without a single regret / That you lived and loved and laughed and cried and followed your dreams / You won't be alone in the end, you don't have to be afraid / Run free and wild, let your heart soar with the eagles / Run free and wild, let your love take over / You won't be alone in the end, you don't have to be afraid / ______________ / Name Run Free / Artist Asking Alexandria / Album From Death To Destiny"/>
