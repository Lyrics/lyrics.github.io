Imcompetent son of a bitch, keep your tongue tight
Cut your losses you're on thin ice so tread light
I don't wanna listen to your "he said, she said" shit
Keep your mouth shut and listen motherfucker
I can't stand this, it was never meant to be so hard
Satisfaction was supposed to come and ease my heart
I don't feel this anymore, I need to get away
All the love in my heart can't even find a way

These words they fall off my tongue like a poison
I hope they kill you all
I hope I never see your faces again
I wanna watch the whole world burn down
I wanna watch the world burn
I wanna watch the whole world burn down

I won't pretend I'm not disgusted with everything you are
I won't deny that I'm revolted by everything you say you stand for
Where do I go? What do I say? Where do I draw the line?
Can I move on? Can I let go before I lose my mind?
Am I alone after everything we've suffered through?
Feels though what once was us has dwindled down to me and you

These words they fall off my tongue like a poison
I hope they kill you all
I hope I never see your faces again
I wanna watch the whole world burn down
I wanna watch the world burn
I wanna watch the whole world burn down
