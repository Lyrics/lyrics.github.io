<title>Asking Alexandria â€“ Believe | Lyrics</title>
<meta name="description" content="You've got to believe / You've got to believe / We've tried it all, tried everything but giving in / I refuse to throw all that we have away / I still recall, I still remember better days / The endless search goes on to light the fire again / We can make a difference here / Just close your eyes and take this hand my dear / Just hold your breath and let me dry your tears / All you've got to do is believe / All you've got to do is believe, believe / All you've got to do is believe / The life you can't understand you just have to reach out and grab it / Our future's out there somewhere waiting to come home / We can make a difference here / Just close your eyes and take this hand my dear / Just hold your breath and let me dry your tears / All you've got to do is believe / You don't have to cry another tear for me / I'll be there 'til the day we die hand in hand / Will you believe in me? Will you believe in me? Will you believe? / We can make a difference here / Just close your eyes and take this hand my dear / Just hold your breath and let me dry your tears / All you've got to do is believe / We can make a difference here / Just close your eyes and take this hand my dear / Just hold your breath and let me dry your tears / All you've got to do is believe / _____________ / Name Believe / Artist Asking Alexandria / Album From Death To Destiny"/>
