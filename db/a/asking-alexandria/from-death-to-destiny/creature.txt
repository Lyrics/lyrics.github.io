Deep in the shadows I'm fighting a battle
The creature wants me screaming, screaming
I think I'm losing, tired of choosing, I'm slipping down
I can't stop screaming, screaming

I'm living a lie, there's a creature hiding inside of me
Black as the night with a cold dead heart and a lust for sin
So I shut it out, I bottle up, I hide it from the world
If I let it out I don't know what I'll do
There's a creature inside of you too

I can't just turn to the menace I've clung to
The creature wants me screaming, screaming
I can't determine, I'm sure that it's hell bent on breaking out and
Hearing you screaming, screaming

I'm living a lie, there's a creature hiding inside of me
Black as the night with a cold dead heart and a lust for sin
So I shut it out, I bottle up, I hide it from the world
If I let it out I don't know what I'll do
There's a creature inside of you too

I can't hold back

I'm living a lie, there's a creature hiding inside of me
Black as the night with a cold dead heart and a lust for sin
So I shut it out, I bottle up, I hide it from the world
If I let it out I don't know what I'll do
There's a creature inside of you too
