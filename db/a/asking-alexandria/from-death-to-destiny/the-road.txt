Street signs, so many street signs pass me by every night and
I know tomorrow I won't recognize the world
Home bound, but I want to be home now
Two more months of empty faces standing there screaming up at me
And I don't know why

I wanna go home I wanna sleep in my own bed
I want a normal life again
Is this the end? Is this the end?
No matter how hard I try, all I know is the road
All I know is the road

Save me, can anyone save me?
I don't know who I am anymore
This was supposed to be the dream
You don't see the pain in my eyes?
You don't hear the pain in my words?
I'm just stuck here cold and alone with no one beside me
And I wanna go home

I wanna go home I wanna sleep in my own bed
I want a normal life again
Is this the end? Is this the end?
No matter how hard I try, all I know is the road
All I know is the road

And you wonder why I'm out of my mind?

I wanna go home I wanna sleep in my own bed
I want a normal life again
Is this the end? Is this the end?
No matter how hard I try, all I know is the road
All I know is the road
