<title>Asking Alexandria â€“ The Road | Lyrics</title>
<meta name="description" content="Street signs, so many street signs pass me by every night and / I know tomorrow I won't recognize the world / Home bound, but I want to be home now / Two more months of empty faces standing there screaming up at me / And I don't know why / I wanna go home I wanna sleep in my own bed / I want a normal life again / Is this the end? Is this the end? / No matter how hard I try, all I know is the road / All I know is the road / Save me, can anyone save me? / I don't know who I am anymore / This was supposed to be the dream / You don't see the pain in my eyes? / You don't hear the pain in my words? / I'm just stuck here cold and alone with no one beside me / And I wanna go home / I wanna go home I wanna sleep in my own bed / I want a normal life again / Is this the end? Is this the end? / No matter how hard I try, all I know is the road / All I know is the road / And you wonder why I'm out of my mind? / I wanna go home I wanna sleep in my own bed / I want a normal life again / Is this the end? Is this the end? / No matter how hard I try, all I know is the road / All I know is the road / ______________ / Name The Road / Artist Asking Alexandria / Album From Death To Destiny"/>
