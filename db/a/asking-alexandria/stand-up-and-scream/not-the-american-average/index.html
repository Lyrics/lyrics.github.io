(All the things that she said was it all in my head?)

Come on baby
Keep it down, honey hush your lips
Clothes trailing from the backdoor to the bedroom
And I don't even know your name (Hoe!)
Give me all you've got
Make this night worth my time
Make this worth my time
Oh what I would give to live this night again
I knew when I first saw you
You'd fuck like a whore
That this would be a night to remember
Hope they hear you screaming for more

Your thighs were made for cheeks to graze
My lips, your poison
They bring you to your knees
Your thighs were made for cheeks to graze
My lips, your poison
They bring you to your knees
(Oh, c'mon)

Girl get down
It's almost over
Take it all the way
You stupid fucking whore
And after all of all my dreaming being only you
You're standing there baby
Oh,the things that I could do
Back to the wall with a drink in my hand
Back it up, baby ride, ride, ride

One step too late and I never told you
That I can't take another disappointment
Breathing and grasping all leads to another messy ending
One step too late and I never told you
That I can't take another disappointment
Breathing and grasping all leads to another messy ending.

(Danny!)

With your back against the wall, with your face buried in the pillow
I see you cold, I feel you heartless

Bitch, you stupid fucking bitch
You stupid fucking bitch

(Fuckin' bitch!)</pre></div>
