I'm so done with it, I won't go back again and
I'm okay with this, that I'll be on my own
Until the day I die, which shouldn't be that long
So I'll just do what I do and make the most of it

I won't fall down again
My heart's now dead and gone
And I'm still breathing
I made it out alive

I won't fall down again
My heart's now dead and gone
And I'm still breathing
I made it out alive
Made it out alive

Oh fuck, this is fun I just can't believe
I didn't find this before
To just indulge even if it kills me
Who gives a fuck if we die?

Who gives a fuck if we die?
Who gives a fuck if we die?

Another bottle down

You should really try it sometime
'Cause it feels so good

You should really try it sometime
'Cause it feels so good

Without a care if a heart gets broken
You'll all learn in the end, there's a better way
Baby move in closer, you couldn't hurt me if you tried

I won't fall down again
My heart's now dead and gone
And I'm still breathing
I made it out alive

I won't fall down again
My heart's now dead and gone
And I'm still breathing
I made it out alive

Take a seat, my dear
Make yourself comfortable, this could take a while
Crack another, dear
I can't see now and I wouldn't change a thing
Life should burn with such a fucking flame
If not you've only got yourself to blame
