Get the fuck away from me

I know that I have done wrong and continue to do so but without remorse
I know that I am on a fast track to the grave and I'm headed there alone

I struggle to find myself this time
Save yourself for a man with a conscience
I fight to find myself this time
Save yourself for a man that is not me

I spend my days looking through pages
Try to find a way to get away from me
A love to give that leaves you breathless
Now all I need to find a way back inside my mind

I don't want to leave you breathless
When will you realize
I don't want to leave you breathless
When will you realize
I don't want to leave you breathless
When will you save yourself

Yeah

I spend my days looking through pages
Try to find a way to get away from me
A love to give that leaves you breathless
Now all I need to find a way back inside my mind

I need to find
A way back inside my mind
I need to find
A way back inside my mind

This is not the end, this is the end of
This is not the end, this is the end of
This is not the end, this is the end of
This is not the end

Every mistake I've made leaves a scar that burns every day
Yet still I carry on
Without regret without remorse, I'm gone
You're better off to walk away
I am corruption, I am sin

Forget my name
Forget my face
Forget my name
Forget my face
