    <div class="view"><pre>Please, you have to help me, this is not my true face
If you could see my soul as I have seen my soul
I could show it to you, it's rotten, it's poison
Help me, please

Please, give me a fucking excuse
I beg for just one reason to give you regret, regret

Are you with me or are you on your own?
It's time to choose your side, so choose your side
Are you with me or are you on your own?
It's time to choose your side, so choose your fucking side

Could be the end of the world, oh oh oh
I'd still be laid here on my own wasting my life away

Could be the end of the world, oh oh oh
I'd still be laid here on my own wasting my life away

Hear me now
Get off your knees
Nothing changes when you pray
I'm the closest thing to a God you'll ever know
Get off your knees
Open your eyes

I'll regret, never again
And I stand above you

I'll regret, never again
And I stand above you

And I can't feel this pain anymore
And I can't carry on this way
I'm hiding behind false eyes

Could be the end of the world, oh oh oh
I'd still be laid here on my own wasting my life away

Could be the end of the world, oh oh oh
I'd still be laid here on my own wasting my life away

Over and over
Over and over

Fucking hell
Fuck</pre></div>
