Go

We're back again, you know we're not fucking around
Got a bottle of jack in our hands, you tryna' keep up kid?
Let's see who hits the ground
We've drank the drinks, we've done the drugs, clearly we don't remember
We've come so far, we've shown them all, without us you'd fall and fade away

They say it all breaks down to keeping your feet on the ground
My sole intention is keeping my head in the clouds
They say that I can't last a day in the real world
I say you wouldn't survive one night in mine

Notorious and shit I wouldn't change it for the world
I'm infamous but damn you can't help but love this shit

Notorious and shit I wouldn't change it for the world
I'm infamous but damn you can't help but love this shit

You can't help but love this shit

I'm everything we need to make this scene what it should have been
Remember platinum albums, sold out stadiums, leave it to me
Let's tell the truth, not to be rude but we're all irrelevant
This music's dead with a bullet in its head
Let's wake it up

It's so insane, I'm so insane
Going insane, I'm so insane

Leave it to me from here
Leave it to me from here</div></div>
