<title>Asking Alexandria â€“ Dear Insanity | Lyrics</title>
<meta name="description" content="Oh, sweet insanity / You take my hand and walk me out into the dark / We walk this road for hours and hours / To the white hills and the oceans / On a collision course, to hell we march / We're doomed to this now / Oh, the irony / If I'm going down I won't go down alone / You're doomed to this one / You're doomed to / You're doomed to this now / You're doomed to / Hold your breath my dear / We're going under, we're going under / Hold your breath my dear / We're going under, we're going under / I've walked this road for hours / To the white hills and the oceans / I search for solace in this toxic land of sin / Just let me in / Don't wake me up, their songs are soothing / Their wine subdues me / Hold your breath my dear / We're going under, we're going under / Hold your breath my dear / We're going under, we're going under / Dreams, my mind won't me lift from my dreams / And though I tried I can't escape my mind / Dreams, my mind won't lift me from my dreams / And though you try you can't escape me / Now you've seen what I've become / Now you've seen what I can do / Now you've seen what I'm capable of / I've walk this road for hours / To the white hills and the oceans / I search for solace in this toxic land of sin / Just let me in / Don't wake me up, their songs are soothing / Their wine subdues me / Welcome to the diary of a man that lost his mind so long ago / Welcome to the shell of a man with a heart so black and cold / Over and over in my head / ___________________ / Name Dear Insanity / Artist Asking Alexandria / Album Reckless And Relentless"/>
