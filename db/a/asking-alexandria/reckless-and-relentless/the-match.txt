Gather 'round my friends
I need a match and only one match
I think it's time I make my own way
I'm turning my back on this city and I'm not looking back
You'll never hear my name without your chest in flames

I'll make my own mistakes
Even though I never learn
I'm running from myself
If only you could see behind my eyes

Run

Get up, get up
Get on your fucking feet
Get up, get up
Get on your fucking feet

Get up, get up
Get up, get up
Get up

I'll make my own mistakes
Even though I never learn
I'm running from myself
If only you could see behind my eyes

Follow me now, I could use some company
Bring your friends and we'll burn this city to the ground

Follow me now, I could use some company
Bring your friends and we'll burn this city to the fucking ground
Burn the temples
Burn the temples

The fires fill the skies as the smoke fills my lungs
What a beautiful notion
A single action brings this city to motion

You all deserve to die
