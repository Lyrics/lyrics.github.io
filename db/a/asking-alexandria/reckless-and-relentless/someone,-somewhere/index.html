<title>Asking Alexandria â€“ Someone, Somewhere | Lyrics</title>
<meta name="description" content="Even though I'm on my own / I know I'm not alone / 'Cause I know there's someone, somewhere / Praying that I make it home / So here's one from the heart / My life right from the start / I need a home sweet home / To call my own / To call my own, to call my own / It was you / Who told me I could do this / You put the music in my heart / And now you sing with a band in Memphis / It's hard just to be strong / Not knowing if I've done you proud / I like to imagine / A smile when you hear my songs / Even though I'm on my own / I know I'm not alone / 'Cause I know there's someone, somewhere / Praying that I make it home / So here's one from my heart / My life right from the start / I need a home sweet home / To call my own / A letter home / And I know we don't speak much / And we both know I'm not keen to / But I think there's things I've left unsaid / I'm okay, don't worry / I wish I'd been a better kid / I'm trying to slow down / I'm sorry for letting you down / Even though I'm on my own / I know I'm not alone / 'Cause I know there's someone, somewhere / Praying that I make it home / So here's one from my heart / My life right from the start / I need a home sweet home / To call my own / Yeah / You know it's just rock and roll / I know you're by my side through it all / My terror twin and I / Let's take over the world / Even though I'm on my own / I know I'm not alone / 'Cause I know there's someone, somewhere / Praying that I make it home / So here's one from my heart / My life right from the start / I need a home sweet home / To call my own / Even though I'm on my own / I know I'm not alone / 'Cause I know there's someone, somewhere / Praying that I make it home / So here's one from my heart / My life right from the start / I need a home sweet home / To call my own / ________________________ / Name Someone, Somewhere / Artist Asking Alexandria / Album Reckless And Relentless"/>
