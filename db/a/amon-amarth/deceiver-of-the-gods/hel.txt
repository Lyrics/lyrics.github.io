Welcome to my humble home
Your soul is mine to keep
There are no walls of rock and stone
Yet no one ever leaves

Those who die of age and plague
Are welcomed in my court
Murderers, miscreants
Will linger here and rot

Those who die inglorious
And those who die in shame
They are all sent to my dark halls
They all shall fear my name

Here hunger is your plate
Here famine is your knife
Here you will forever dwell
I welcome you to Hel

I welcome you to Hel

Now here you are in my cold realm
You are my honored guest
At the banquette of the dead
Your soul will never rest

Your soul is mine to keep (Your soul is mine to keep)
And you will never leave (And you will never leave)

Here sickness is your bed
Here ruin is your fell
Here you will forever dwell
I welcome you to
Here hunger is your plate
Here famine is your knife
Here you will forever dwell
I welcome you to Hel
