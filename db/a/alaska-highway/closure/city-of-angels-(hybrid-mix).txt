You can't break all that you please
Spread through me like some disease
Retalliation comes with time
Retribution shall be mine

City Of Angels, I've returned
The bridge I've crossed we now must burn
Let them fall beneath your sky
By the blade I live and die

City Of Angels fight with me
Defend your heart and dignity
Featured stars fall from the sky
By the blade I live and die

You XXX to a slaughter
Filthy ashes drowned in water
Phoenix never to arise
In this place where all hope dies

City Of Angels, I've returned
The bridge I've crossed we now must burn
Let them fall beneath the sky
By the blade I live and die

City Of Angels fight with me
Defend your heart and dignity
Featured stars fall from the sky
By the blade we live and die

City Of Angels, I've returned
The bridge I've crossed we now must burn
Let them fall beneath the sky
By the blade I live and die

City Of Angels, fight with me
Defend your heart and dignity
Featured stars fall from the sky
By the blade we live and die
