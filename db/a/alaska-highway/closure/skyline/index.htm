<div><pre>Here the buildings
Are higher than the ones you've known
And it's much darker on this side
See why my heart I had to hide

It's in this place
I may be some prince, some king, some freak
But it means nothing without your hand
Here in mine

But tonight I'm going to the city
To forget you
But tonight I'm going to the city
To forget you

How could I erase someone
That means so much to me?
Though I may have let you go
Inside my mind it's still not free

Here I'm stronger
No emotions to bring me down
But what is it a heart
If we don't tear it apart
In a masquerade of game we play?

The lights above us
These towers we could never climb
You once were a star to lead me away
From the pain within my own decay

But tonight I'm going to the city
To forget you
But tonight I'm going to the city
To forget you

How could I erase someone
That means so much to me?
Though I may have let you go
Inside my mind it's still not free

But tonight I'm going to the city
To forget you
But tonight I'm going to the city
To forget you

But tonight I'm going to the city
To forget you
But tonight I'm going to the city
To forget you

How could I erase someone
That means so much to me?
Though I may have let you go
Inside my mind it's still not free

But tonight I'm going to the city

To forget you
To forget you

To forget you
To forget you
