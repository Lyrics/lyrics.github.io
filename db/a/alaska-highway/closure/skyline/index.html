<title>Alaska Highway â€“ Skyline | Lyrics</title>
<meta name="description" content="Here the buildings / Are higher than the ones you've known. / And it's much darker on this side, / See why my heart I had to hide. / It's in this place / I may be some prince, some king, some freak. / But it means nothing without your hand / Here in mine. / But tonight I'm going to the city / To forget you. / But tonight I'm going to the city / To forget you. / How could I erase someone / That means so much to me? / Though I may have let you go, / Inside my mind it's still not free. / Here I'm stronger. / No emotions to bring me down. / But what is it a heart / If we don't tear it apart / In a masquerade of game we play? / The lights above us, / These towers we could never climb. / You once were a star to lead me away / From the pain within my own decay. / But tonight I'm going to the city / To forget you. / But tonight I'm going to the city / To forget you. / How could I erase someone / That means so much to me? / Though I may have let you go, / Inside my mind it's still not free. / But tonight I'm going to the city / To forget you. / But tonight I'm going to the city / To forget you / But tonight I'm going to the city / To forget you. / But tonight I'm going to the city / To forget you. / How could I erase someone / That means so much to me? / Though I may have let you go, / Inside my mind it's still not free. / But tonight I'm going to the city / To forget you. / To forget you. / To forget you. / To forget you. / _____________ / Name Skyline / Artist Alaska Highway / Album Closure"/>
