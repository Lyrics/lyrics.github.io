<div><pre>People never see the other side of darkness.
There's no fear,
The faces of those you've hurt, they cannot even be seen,
But you'll never forget the one [who you meet] in the dark.

Within this place I've sensed no evil
Only the absence of hurt that I had felt.
Death holds my heart and keeps me imprisoned
To shield me from another fall.

Without caution, I moved towards nothing
And you have seen me somehow.
The imperfection in your mirrored reflection of a beauty
That died inside of me.

Darkness comforts me in this moment,
Slipping into comas of complication,
I want to embrace you, hold you.
The mind is plagued with the morbid hesitation.
Just tell me you're suffering and I will give you everything
Though I have nothing,
But the darkness in my eyes.
The darkness in your eyes...

You found me in this, I found you a rose... of death.
Do I want you, could you want me, accept my bouquet of decay?
Am I an image that comforts your fantasy or will this surface turn my dark reality?
Are you the one, am I the one?
The wraiths have left me, and sun will kill us, suddenly kill us.

Darkness comforts me in this moment,
Slipping into comas of complication,
I want to embrace you, hold you.
The mind is plagued with the morbid hesitation.
Just tell me you're suffering and I will give you everything
Though I have nothing,
But the darkness in my eyes.
The darkness in your eyes...

Follow the roses down into the depths and you'll see what has brought you here.
The wounds of the heart, the depletion of faith and the darkness inside your eyes,
Darkness inside my eyes,
Darkness inside your eyes.
[inside my eyes]
