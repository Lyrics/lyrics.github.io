The sound of your name
Upon my heart
Has left a stain

And I know that we must say goodbye
But without you inside my heart may die

But I don't want the perfect rose
The one you say that I deserve
All I know is that I loved you
Hold you when you cry
Without you I would rather die

And I have done everything that I can do
But I just can't keep you

And I don't want the perfect rose
The one you say that I deserve
All I know is that I loved you
Hold you when you cry
Without you I would rather die

And I am not the perfect rose
The one I think that you deserve
All I know is that I love you

I love you
