You never gave me your strength
But I've always been stronger
You never gave me your love
But I've given you mine

You were just an illusion
My tormenting confusion
Was I ever good enough for you?

You were a butterfly in the glass jar
That I could never let go
Sewed and wrapped your wings off
So you couldn't fly away
Fly away from me

(just let me go)
(please, just let me go)

You never gave me your strength
Your love, your anything
Was I just an illusion,
Some tormenting confusion?
Was I ever good enough for you?

You were a butterfly in the glass jar
That I could never let go
Sewed and wrapped your wings off
So you couldn't fly away
Fly away from me

You were the person I could imagine
Spending the rest of my life with
In your arms, in your arms

I could never let you fly away
Please don't leave me, I said
(don't you) Don't you go
I don't wanna live without you
I don't wanna die within you

You were my butterfly
You're my butterfly

Please don't leave me, I said
Don't you go, please
Please don't leave
Don't leave me
Don't leave me, don't
Don't leave me, don't
Don't leave, don't you go
