<title>Alaska Highway â€“ Even Angels Have to Die | Lyrics</title>
<meta name="description" content="Even angels have to die / With their ascension buried deeper / Our world, in time, shall become a grave / Inside there will be dirt instead of feelings / All our hearts must learn to break / For nothing beautiful lasts forever / The longing of what's lost shall never fade / A void is left and we feel so empty / Even angels have to die / No love on earth can restrain its ending / Sadness waits to claim our fall / And mourn for love that seeks its savior / Darkness finds me in my fate / The beautiful face which may bring salvation / Souls embrace a shattering wound / Have I strength to admit my desperation? / Please save me from apathy / That drains my sympathy / Just speak those words that need to be / You can't promise to never die / Even angels have to die / But love is worth the tears that it brings me / I'll bleed with you 'til I am drained / Though my color may be less than perfect / Could the intent be to invade / This place where nothing dreams eternal? / Fear that you'll be torn away / Had lead me to my own decay / This thought of wasting haunts my mind / For my heart can't lose another angel / Please save me from apathy / That drains my sympathy / Just speak those words that need to be / You can't promise to never die / Save me from apathy / That drains my sympathy / Just speak those words that need to be / You can't promise to never die / _____________________________ / Name Even Angels Have to Die / Artist Alaska Highway / Album Attitudes of a Difficult Mind"/>
