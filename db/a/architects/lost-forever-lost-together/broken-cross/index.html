    <div class="view"><pre>God only knows why we were born to burn, uh

If God is my witness, He'll see that all is not well
Christ, what a sight for sore eyes
Looking down on us, all the children that You despise
God only knows why we were born to burn, uh

God only knows why we were born to burn

A bullet in the neck don't feel much like love
A message of rejection, sent from above
No flags, no holy books
I'll be in hell with the misunderstood

The sons and daughters that You wished to forget
A desperate picture of God's regret
Are we perfect mistakes or almighty fuck ups?
One thing's for sure; He doesn't fucking love us

He doesn't fucking love us

Hate must weigh on You like a broken cross
Hate; the dividing line we'll never step across

Outcast and reject
Outcast and reject

Father, Father, how I've let You down
A fucking tyrant in a hollow crown
Father, Father, how I've let You down
A fucking tyrant in a hollow crown

The sons and daughters that You wished to forget
A desperate picture of God's regret
Are we perfect mistakes or almighty fuck ups?
One thing's for sure; He doesn't fucking love us

He doesn't fucking love us
He doesn't fucking love us</pre></div>
