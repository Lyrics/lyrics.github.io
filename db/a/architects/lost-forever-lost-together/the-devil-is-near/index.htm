<div><pre>Hey, hey, they live this, day and night
This is sacrifice, no fucking compromise
Hey, hey, they have the heart to resist
Whilst the hunters hunt they will persist

This is where tragedy is bought and sold
It seems their pain is worth its weight in gold
You know they're here when the water is red
Our fading life support is hanging by a thread

A message etched on broken ships

Hey, hey, they live this, day and night
This is sacrifice, no fucking compromise
Hey, hey, they have the heart to resist
Whilst the hunters hunt they will persist

You can hear them cry
They're calling out to the Mother, lost
She's bleeding out

She's bleeding out

Their innocence is heaven sent
Their malevolence, it will not relent
A graveyard sits upon the shore
They won't swim together anymore

The tide will rush with waves of fear
Selling souls, the devil is near
The tide will rush with waves of fear
Selling souls, the devil is near

The devil is near

"If we're going to survive on this planet
We have to respect the right of all species to survive
For we need them more than they need us"

A message etched on broken ships
We'll be here till corruption quits
There is a voice though they cannot speak
Not yet ready to admit defeat

You can hear them cry
They're calling out to the Mother, lost
She's bleeding out
You can hear them cry
They're calling out to the Mother, lost
She's bleeding out

Where tragedy is bought and sold
It seems their pain is worth its weight in gold</pre></div>
