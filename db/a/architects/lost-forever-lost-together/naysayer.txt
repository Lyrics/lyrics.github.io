Say what you like, I know what I am
Sometimes a flood starts with a leak in the dam
You said we'd never make a difference
Maybe this battle is to fight indifference?

Naysayer

Naysayer, hammer the nail
We're all on our own, we can't decide what's true
Betrayer, hammer the nail
Such narrow lines separate me and you

So sick of the sound of people giving up
You can't stop me giving a fuck
Fuck it, I'm a dreamer and I'm dreaming on
Fuck it, I'm a dreamer and I'm dreaming on

With every concession, another piece of us dies
Will we fight for nothing if not our lives?
Apathy is our new messiah
Only He could let things get so dire

All the messengers found knives in their backs
Apathy is our new messiah
The word made flesh, you can't fight fire with fire
All the messengers found knives in their backs

I know it haunts you; it haunts me too
We're all on our own, we can't decide what's true
Why are we fighting, when I'm just like you?

Naysayer

Naysayer, hammer the nail
We're all on our own, we can't decide what's true
Betrayer, hammer the nail
Such narrow lines separate me and you

So sick of the sound of people giving up
You can't stop me giving a fuck
Fuck it, I'm a dreamer and I'm dreaming on
Fuck it, I'm a dreamer and I'm dreaming on

Apathy is the new messiah
The word made flesh, you can't fight fire with fire
