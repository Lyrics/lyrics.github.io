I am your hero
Still I sleep alone at night
In years you'll thank me
For getting everything right
I am the sun
Still I sit alone in a red sky
Keeping my eyes on you
Were all alone

In time you'll find that
Were all on our own (all on our own)
Were all on our own , chasing nothing
My dreams have fallen , I'm wearing thin
I need something to fill this void I'm constantly in
And I can't do this

I am your hero
I just don't care tonight
In years you'll forget me
I got everything right
I am the sun
I didn't rise today
I left you in darkness

And I just don't care anymore about you
You can sit and suffer alone without me

I am your hero
Save your "thank you"'s

In times to come ill rise above this
But for now I can't ill just sit here
My dreams have fallen once again
My dreams have fallen once again

I need something to fill this void I'm in
