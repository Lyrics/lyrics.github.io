<title>Architects â€“ A Match Made In Heaven | Lyrics</title>
<meta name="description" content="Tell me was it all worth it to watch your kingdom grow? / All the anchors in the ocean haven't sunk this low / Sunk this low / (Rotten to the core) / So who's left to count the cost? / Beneath the ruin lies a story of the lives lost / Now we're gone, left without a trace / But we took something they cannot replace / A match made in heaven paved the road to hell / We've been down this path before / Cold blooded retribution / So fuck your revolution / You chew up peace and spit it out as war / You've been feeding the wolf that's waiting at the door / You are rotten to the core / We found your fingerprints all over the trigger / If you're looking for tyrants, take a look in the mirror / You knew all along that the cancer would spread / So don't be surprised to find a price on your head / Sorry son but we destroyed your home / We murdered your family, now you're on your own / Collateral damage, face down in the sand / Watch the dominoes fall, it's all just part of the plan / A match made in heaven paved the road to hell / We've been down this path before / Cold blooded retribution / So fuck your revolution / A match made in heaven paved the road to hell / We've been down this path before / And every execution / The price of your collusion / Tell me was it all worth it to watch your kingdom grow? / All the anchors in the ocean haven't sunk this low / Sunk this low / You are rotten to the core / You are rotten to the core / You are rotten to the core / You are rotten to the core / ____________________________ / Name A Match Made In Heaven / Artist Architects / Album All Our Gods Have Abandoned Us"/>
