    <div class="view"><div id="lyrics">The weight of the world is resting on thin ice
When the surface breaks will I find paradise?
As I freeze to death, left to reflect
What a waste of time I was in retrospect

I'd take a leap of faith but I'd lose my nerve
In the end I'll get the hell that I deserve

I'm always gone with the wind
Crawling in and out of my mind
God knows I lost all my faith

A sickness with no remedy
Except the ones inside of me
You ever wonder how deep
You can sink into nothing at all?
Disintegrate, annihilate me

Annihilate me

Do you remember when you said to me
"My friend, hope is a prison"?
Hope is a prison

Of all the patterns that I could create
I built a labyrinth with no escape
To keep myself under lock and key
I am my own worst enemy

I'd take a leap of faith but I'd lose my nerve
In the end I'll get the hell that I deserve

I'm always gone with the wind
Crawling in and out of my mind
(God knows I lost all my faith)

A sickness with no remedy
Except the ones inside of me
You ever wonder how deep
You can sink into nothing at all?
Disintegrate, annihilate me

A sickness with no remedy
Except the ones inside of me
You ever wonder how deep
You can sink into nothing at all?
Disintegrate, annihilate me

If I could silence all the doubt in me
Accept that what is meant to be (Is meant to be)
You ever wonder how deep
You can sink into nothing at all?
Disintegrate, annihilate me

I remember when you said to me
"My friend, hope is a prison"</div></div>
