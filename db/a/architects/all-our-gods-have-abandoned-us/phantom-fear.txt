Contaminated, nothing is sacred
Born and bred on pure hatred
'Cause they haunt our streets with a phantom fear
No one is safe, no one is welcome here

No one is welcome here

Can you taste the poison in the air?
I swear it's everywhere, it's everywhere
Hidden in plain sight, lost in black and white
I'll chase the dying of the light

They want the victims to hang their heads in shame
Well fuck them all, we won't play their game
We won't play their game
I've seen through every word the prophets propagate

This is a failed state
So read between the lines
This is a failed state

No love, no empathy
Our fellow man is now our enemy
No love, no unity
Erase our souls, distort reality

Can you taste the poison in the air?
I swear it's everywhere, it's everywhere
Hidden in plain sight, lost in black and white
I'll chase the dying of the light

They will sow the seeds of blind contempt
Then let us bleed until our heart's content
Hidden in plain sight, lost in black and white
I'll chase the dying of the light

No love, no empathy
Our fellow man is now our enemy

No love, no empathy
No love, no unity
Our fellow man is now our enemy
