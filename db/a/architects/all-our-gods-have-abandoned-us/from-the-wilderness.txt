There is no end game
So whisper the truth and pass on the blame
Just put us out of our misery, this defeat is a victory
We're burning out, we're fading away

A failed evolution
Is the problem the solution
That they've been searching for?

We're waiting for the world to save itself
'Cause nothing is built to last
We're writing our epitaph
So reset and start again
'Cause we all know how this ends
Before long we'll be dead and gone

A thorn in the side of the earth
Where do you draw the line? A flaw in the design
The rest is history, this defeat is a victory
We're burning out, we're fading away

We're all guilty as sin
I feel it, I feel it under my skin
Always up in arms without lifting a finger
Lifting a finger

We may be infinite but this world is not
Something that we once knew that we long forgot
That we long forgot

We're waiting for the world to save itself
'Cause nothing is built to last
We're writing our epitaph
So reset and start again
'Cause we all know how this ends
Before long we'll be dead and gone

We're all guilty as sin
I feel it, I feel it under my skin
Always up in arms without lifting a finger
Lifting a finger

We may be infinite but this world is not
Something that we once knew that we long forgot
