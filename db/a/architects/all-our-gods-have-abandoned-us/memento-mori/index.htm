<div><pre>As above, so below
Dismantled piece by piece, what's left will not decease
As within, so without
The seasons bring relief, let me live and die in peace

(Let me live and die in peace)
(Let me live and die in peace)
(Let me live and die in peace)
(Let me live and die in peace)

I will be consumed, returned into the earth
Only passing through, nothing left to hold on to
Like the thaw against the snow, into the undertow
Cut the chord and cast me out, and cast me out

It's a promise that you cannot break
Was your life worth dying for?
The universe survives on give and take
Death is an open door

It's a promise that you cannot break
Was your life worth dying for?
The universe survives on give and take
Decay is the only law

As above, so below
Dismantled piece by piece, what's left will not decease
As within, so without
The seasons bring relief, just let me live and die in peace

"Change
And everything is change; nothing can be held on to
To the degree that you go with a stream
You see, you are are still; you are flowing with it
But to the degree you resist the stream
Then you notice that the current is rushing past you and fighting you
So swim with it, go with it, and you're there; you're at rest"

It'll wear you down through skin and bone, through skin and bone
It's as if my mind has a mind of its own, has a mind of its own
It'll wear you down through skin and bone, through skin and bone
It's as if my mind has a mind of its own, has a mind of its own

When my heart skips two beats
I am hidden deep, fast asleep
The sea will part where oceans meet
Finally complete

It's a promise that you cannot break
Was your life worth dying for?
The universe survives on give and take
Death is an open door

It's a promise that you cannot break
Was your life worth dying for?
The universe survives on give and take
Decay's the only law

Swan song, a declaration of endlessness
I swear I will not look back as I return into the black
When the veil lifts, how will I know, how will I know?
Will I see God?

As above, so below
Dismantled piece by piece, what's left will not decease
As within, so without
The seasons bring relief, just let me live and die in peace

"You can't hang on to yourself
You don't have to try to not hang on to yourself
It can't be done, and that is salvation
Memento mori: be mindful of death"</pre></div>
