Every moment is dead to me

Do you remember? Because I can't forget
The saddest story of all that ever was
Or will be, laid out before me
A living heart attack, play it back, play it back

Take my eyes, I cannot see sense
Past and future tense, every moment is dead to me
Safe and sound, anywhere but here
I see it crystal clear but it means nothing to me

It means nothing to me
It means nothing to me

Have you seen a future filled with regret?
Breathe and count to ten, start over again
You want to run away, just let yourself decay
A living heart attack, play it back, play it back

The empty hourglass, we're going nowhere fast
There's no more time to kill if time is standing still

Take my eyes, I cannot see sense
Past and future tense, every moment is dead to me
Safe and sound, anywhere but here
I see it crystal clear but it means nothing to me

It means nothing to me
It means nothing to me

Play it back, play it back
Over and over again
Over and over again

The empty hourglass, we're going nowhere fast
There's no more time to kill if time is standing still
