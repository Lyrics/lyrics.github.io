The Son of God, hangman's pawn
Control our lives with fairy-tales and shallow lies

You say we'll burn in Hell...;
Spiteful preacher, I know you well!

Desperation breathes and follows you home
Just look around– you're not alone...;
One life, one chance; the world in front of me

Intelligent design, sending shivers up my spine
Cells mutate and divide
What a sadistic intention

No light! No dark!
No ups! No downs!
I'll find peace, buried in the ground

The lights go out
The fuse has blown
No Heaven or Hell to bring– me– home

You say we'll burn in Hell...;
Spiteful preacher, I know you well!

Desperation breathes and follows you home
Just look around– you're not alone
One life, one chance; the world in front of me

Another division to tear us apart
Try to fill the hole inside your heart
Another division to tear us apart
Try to fill the hole inside your heart

Sun of god, Sun in the sky–
If you could speak, I'm sure you'd say:
"There's more to me than meets the eye...;"

Sun of god, Sun in the sky–
If you could speak, I'm sure you'd say:
"There's more to me than meets the eye...;"
("There's more to me, there's more to me!")

Sun of god, Sun in the sky–
If you could speak, I'm sure you'd say:
"There's more to me than meets the eye...;"
("There's more to me, there's more to me...;")

Let me say, my decency comes from inside–
Just human heart, a decent mind
We all slip up from time– to– time!

Let me say, my decency comes from inside–
Just human heart, a decent mind
We all slip up from TIME– to– TIME!
