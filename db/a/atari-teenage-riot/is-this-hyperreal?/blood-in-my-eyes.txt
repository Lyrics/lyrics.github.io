It's a dangerous place
And you don't know how to behave.

She killed her heart
She took his soul
I'ma sergeon of cutting
It all feels numb
When you can't wash off that smell
You really don't want to live
You really just want to,
You really just want to.

So much blood, so much blood
So much blood, so much blood
Too much blood, too much blood.

Where'd you get your delusions from?
1 2 3 4
Where'd you get your delusions from?
Where'd you get your delusions from?

Blood in my eyes, i get blood in my eyes
I get blood in my eyes
I get....
Blood in my eyes, blood in my eyes
I get blood in my eyes, i get blood in my eyes,
Reconstructive surgery
And can specify how old you want to be.
Snake heads, snake heads, they're just snake heads
Because you just talk anyway!

When men stop mutilating their favorite girls
Then something scary has been let loose among us
But i feel like an explosion of
Too much blood!

Where'd you get your delusions from?
Where'd you get your delusions from?
Come on!
Where'd you get your delusions from?
Where'd you get your delusions from?

Blood in my eyes, i get
Blood in my eyes, i get
Blood in my eyes, i got ..
Blood in my eyes, blood in my eyes.
Blood in my eyes, blood in my eyes.
