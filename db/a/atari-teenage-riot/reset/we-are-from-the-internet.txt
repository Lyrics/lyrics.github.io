When nobody knows your face
Or knows who you are
There are no re restrictions to who you can be

You are the one

Don't let them tell you you're nothing
Because you know it isn't true

You matter not because of who you once were
Or where you came from
You matter because of who you are in this moment

You control your convictions, character and values
You as an individual, you matter
They frame you, they limit you
Before you can take your chance

Identity
Become plenty
When you're anonymous, no mob can find you
Discriminate against you, bully or segregate you
