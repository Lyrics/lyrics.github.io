I saw the reflection of the hellfire
With my own eyes
I do whatever feels right
It comes at a high price

In this game you die the moment you freeze
But always remember
When we've overcome our fears
We'll truly be free

Getting closer
We're getting closer

Go

We'll reach the goal
Getting closer

It's a thrill, it's a rush, it's a suicide pill
A beggar on a corner tells me about Jesus
While a skeleton in a fur coat
Being driven in a limousine

We all live for that perfect moment
Dangerous, it's so much fun
Cause when you've woken up you see
When you've woken up you see

Street demon
Fly, fly, fly
Everything slows down
There is no time

Getting closer
I will make it, I will make it, I will make it
I will make it, I will make it
CraÂ§h
