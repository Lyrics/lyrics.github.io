Erase your face

I get out of the house and walk towards the station
It's dark, deserted, I'm feeling lonely but connected
Every move is being recorded and I know it
But my anger is a gift
And my biggest secret is that I actually stopped existing

I'm surprised how indifferent so many feel about the surveillance scandal
Look up Germany's history
I have spoken to people who lived in Nazi and eastern socialist Germany
The spying on your life by the state is one thing but what it does to your friends and family in the long run is beyond anything you can imagine right now
You lose trust in people you love, every conversation becomes half lie / half truth
It becomes part of everybody's lives
Nobody is an exception
Ignore music, games or whatever you do right now and research the topic
Anything you have said in the past can be twisted against you in a surveillance state
Made the wrong joke in private?
You are constantly being blackmailed by those in charge
History has shown that these types of societies never last
They get so corrupted with lies that many people will suffer in the end
Everybody loses
