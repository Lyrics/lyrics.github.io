Many of us live in a world of pure hype
And you know you're right
When haters make shit up that is not true
They justify their hate
Because they can't attack you otherwise

You're lucky when no one thinks you're rich
We can't help who our parents are
You know that as well as I do
But it's what we do from this point on
That will define us, that will define us

You hold the key

Two halves can make a whole
Aren't we all the genetic product
Of two completely different people?
We all hold the key to it all
A lot of money or a lot of meaning

I've been standing here for 55 minutes
Waiting for the air to get cold
I can't even notice a slight variation
Of pressure is pressure is pressure
You hold the key
