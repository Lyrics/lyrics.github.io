    <div class="view"><pre>Stuck by the news, it's hard to hear a fucking sound
They're kicking down the doors and taking everyone down
And I know for sure that I can't trust you anymore
A history in violence and they're coming for some more

Public enemies as far as you can see
They're loading their guns and marching the streets
A flag with no meaning, a religion of deceit
You can't arrest the idea

New blood
End of the dark night clouds clear run free

New blood
No more waiting, don't buy what they're saying

New blood
What the hell are they talking about
Stuck in a rut and we must get out

New blood
Too much is at stake

High tech, low life, digits without numbers
I'm sick of running
I see the masses without people
And I know for sure that I can't trust it anymore

Governments pointing guns at their own people
It has come that far
Invent your god, praise a lie
You can't arrest the idea

New blood
There's too much at stake, way too much at stake

New blood
Run free

New blood
Don't buy into what they're saying

New blood
Attack, run, go</pre></div>
