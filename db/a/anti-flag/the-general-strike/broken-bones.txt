Broken bones and broken glass
Broken hearts and broken heads
Livin' the life

Close my eyes try to make it last
Outrun the wretched memories of my past
It moves too fast
I got no chance
A freight train racing set to crash

Broken bones and broken glass
Broken hearts and broken heads
Livin' the life
Broken bones and broken glass
Broken hearts and broken heads
Livin' the life

Wake up wondering: "How' did I get here?"
Then cross my heart and say a fuckin' prayer
Ecstasy, tears
Bravery, fears
This boat may float but it don't steer

Broken bones and broken glass
Broken hearts and broken heads
Livin' the life
Broken bones and broken glass
Broken hearts and broken heads
Livin' the life

Life's long and winding roads leading us to
A never ending trail to keep our youth
It flashes by in lessons painfully attained
Blood and sweat, black and blue
Some surrender I got nothing' to surrender to

Broken bones and broken glass
Broken hearts and broken heads
Livin' the life

So now you're livin'
So now you're livin'

Broken bones and broken glass
Broken hearts and broken heads
Livin' the life
Broken bones and broken glass
Broken hearts and broken heads
Livin' the life

Close my eyes try to make it last
Outrun the wretched memories of my past
