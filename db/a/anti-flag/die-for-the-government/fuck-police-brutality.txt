A bunch of punks hangin' out on the streets before a show.
Patty wagon pulls up -instinct- 'Run man, let's just go!'
Cop chaces them through the streets and then they go inside
They run into a crowd where maybe they can hide

Fuck police
Fuck police
Fuck police brutality!! (*4)

He hides just standing in the crowd
there's nowhere he can run
The cop comes up behind him and he cracks him with his gun.
Drags his bloody ass outside and throws him to the ground.
'There's nowhere else to take you boy, you're already downtown.'

Fuck police
Fuck police
Fuck police brutality!! (*4)

But the cops can do no wrong.
They can kill, they can rape, they can do what they want,
But the cops can do no wrong.
We've got to fight, take back the night,
the cops are just like Hitler's Third Reich,
do what they want.

Who do we fear? Who do we trust? How do we know?
Who do we fear? Who do we trust? How do we know?

Fuck police
Fuck police
Fuck police brutality!! (*8)
