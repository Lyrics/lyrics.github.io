    <div class="view"><pre>Seems every station on the TV
Is selling something no one can be
If every page was torn from the magazine
would cash still drive the media machine?
The products, damage and pursuit are endless
Identity can leave you selfless

We will not witness this anymore
This is the end for you my friend
I can't forgive, I won't forget
On and on, we sing our songs and
On and on, the wars wage on and
On and on, we sing our songs for more
For more

Your eyes are open but you can't see
Your mouth is moving but you don't speak
A blitzkrieg of images to break your will
I hope you choke on every pill

We will not witness this anymore
This is the end for you my friend
I can't forgive, I won't forget
On and on, we sing our songs and
On and on, the wars wage on and
On and on, we sing our songs for more

We will not witness this anymore
This is the end for you my friend
I can't forgive, I won't forget...

This is the end for you my friend
I can't forgive, I won't forget
On and on, we sing our songs and
On and on, the wars wage on and
On and on, we sing our songs and
On and on, the wars wage on and
On and on, we sing our songs and
On and on, your wars wage on and
On and on, we sing our songs for more
We sing our songs for more</pre></div>
