I ain't too keen on playing games.
I ain't the kind to name names.

Someone has my heart.
Someone's not there.
Someone likes the jukebox.
Someone talks in tongues.
Someone wears a purple dress.
You make me laugh.
You know who you are.
I ain't too keen on playing games.
I ain't the kind to name names.

Someone has my heart.
Someone's not there.
Someone likes the jukebox.
Someone talks in tongues.
Someone wears a purple dress.
You make me laugh.
You know who you are.
