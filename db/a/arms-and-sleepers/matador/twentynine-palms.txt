I wanted on my body a legion of your armies
to spread a canvas on me, to bury you upon me.

You came without a warning.

A message on my body.
A blessing on my body.

I saw it on your body;
In pink, in porcelain, Ivory.
The threads, a canvas awning.
I carry you upon me.

You came without a warning.

A message on my body.
A blessing on my body.
