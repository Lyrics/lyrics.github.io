    <div class="view"><pre>At least you could have tried
It is way past time and we're scattering ashes
You take everything in sight, please hear me now
You, you are leaving me with scars

Fear is the weakness in all of us
It's sad to see you go
It's not meant to be easy but you drag us down
Burden of the evidence grows

The same road for far too long
It's not meant to be
We're losing identity
Faith has been denied let's not pretend
This is the first time we just don't belong

What world do you perceive?
All turn cold, no one cares for anyone
Waiting for a final blow
Do you have strength at all?
One more day then we fade away

Fear is the weakness in all of us
It's sad to see you go
It's not meant to be easy but you drag us down
Burden of the evidence grows

The same road for far too long
It's not meant to be
We're losing identity
Faith has been denied let's not pretend
This is the first time we just don't belong

The same road for far too long
It's not meant to be
We're losing identity
Faith has been denied let's not pretend
This is the first time we just don't belong</pre></div>
