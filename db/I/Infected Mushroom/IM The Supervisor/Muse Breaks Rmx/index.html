Take it to your top and now watch me get in
Feel the sun is up and now let the vibe in
Don't you feel the rain drops are near
You're the only tool to break the music
And your time is so useless
And your days are not of muse breaks
feel me get in
(oh man)
feel me get in
(oh yeah)

Take me up and out
Cause rainy days are all I feel
I'm walking about
I know that, there's no time
In the days of muse breaks
I had to hang on tight
Looking back I wish I had more time for, you...

Take it to your top and now watch me get in
Feel the sun is up and now let the vibe in
Don't you feel the rain drops are near
You're the only tool for reggae music
And your time is so useless
And your days are not a muse breaks
Feel me get in... (feel me get in) (*oh man*)
Feel me get in... (feel me get in) (*oh yeah*)
Feel me get in... (feel me get in) (*Cho, Cho...*)
Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh Haaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
Ahhhhhhhh Haaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!!!

(*Duvdev in metal voice*)
Take it straight up and watch me get it
Feel it when the sun is up and let the vibe in
Don't you feel the rain drops are near
You're the only tool to break the music
And your time is so useless
And your days are not of muse breaks
Get in...

Take it straight up and watch me get it
Feel it when the sun is up and let the vibe in
Don't you feel the rain drops are near
You're the only tool to break the music
And your time is so useless
And your days are not of muse breaks
Feel me get in...
Feel me get in...
Feel me get in... Haaaaaaaaaa Ahhhhhhhhhhhhh
HaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaHHhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!

Take me up and out
Cause rainy days are all I feel
I'm walking about
I know that, there's no time
In the days of muse breaks
I had to hang on tight
Looking back I wish I had more time for, you...</pre></div>
