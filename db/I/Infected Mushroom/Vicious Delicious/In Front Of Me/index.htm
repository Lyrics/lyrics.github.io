    <div class="view"><pre>Why can't I see what's in front of me?
Why can't I see what's in front of me?

I see the doors that I can't open
Adding locks from time to time
When it opens something blocks me
And I'm asking myself why?
Did I take the step I wanted
Was it just a state of mind?
I feel sorry for myself
Every time I close my eyes

And I fall into a hole
And I can take no more...
And I fall into a hole
And I can take no more...
And I fall into a hole
And I can take no more...
And I fall into a hole
And I can take no more...

Why can't I see what's in front of me?
Why can't I see what's in front of me?

What's behind the door I wonder?
Must be brighter than my past
Will I feel a little different
When I take myself across?
Was it really worth the journey?
Was it just a foolish task?
I feel sorry for myself
When I open up my eyes...

And I fall into a hole
And I can take no more
And I fall into a hole
And I can take no more
And I fall into a hole
And I can take no more
And I fall into a hole
And I can take no more....</pre></div>
