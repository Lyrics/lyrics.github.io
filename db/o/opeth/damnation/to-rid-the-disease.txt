There's
Nobody here
There's
Nobody near
I
Try not to care
Dead
Eyes always stare

Let
These matters be
Don't trust what you see
Take
Hold of your time
Step into the line

There's innocence torn from its maker
Stillborn the trust in you
This failure has made the creator
So would you tell him
What to do? (would you?)

Leave
Your mark upon
The
Head of someone
Who'll
Cry for his state
We
Know it's too late
I turn around to see
What was meant to be
Faint
Movement release
To rid the disease

There's innocence torn from its maker
Stillborn the trust in you (I have lost all trust I had in you)
This failure has made the creator
So would you tell him
What to do?
(I have lost all trust I had in you)
