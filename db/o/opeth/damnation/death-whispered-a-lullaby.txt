Out on the road
There are fireflies circling
Deep in the woods
Where the lost souls hide
Over the hill
There are men returning
Trying to find
Some peace of mind

Oh
Sleep my child
Oh
Sleep my child
Oh
Sleep my child
Oh
Sleep my child
Oh

Under the fog
There are shadows moving
Don't be afraid
Hold my hand
Into the dark
There are eyelids closing
Buried alive
In the shifting sands

Oh
Sleep my child
Oh
Sleep my child
Oh
Sleep my child
Oh
Sleep my child
Oh

Speak to me now
And the world will crumble
Open a door
And the moon will fall
All of your life
All your memories
Go to your dreams,
Forget it all

Oh
Sleep my child
Oh
Sleep my child
Oh
Sleep my child
Oh
Sleep my child
Oh
