<title>Opeth â€“ To Rid The Disease | Lyrics</title>
<meta name="description" content="There's / Nobody here / There's / Nobody near / I / Try not to care / Dead / Eyes always stare / Let / These matters be / Don't trust what you see / Take / Hold of your time / Step into the line / There's innocence torn from its maker / Stillborn the trust in you / This failure has made the creator / So would you tell him / What to do? (would you?) / Leave / Your mark upon / The / Head of someone / Who'll / Cry for his state / We / Know it's too late / I turn around to see / What was meant to be / Faint / Movement release / To rid the disease / There's innocence torn from its maker / Stillborn the trust in you (I have lost all trust I had in you) / This failure has made the creator / So would you tell him / What to do? / (I have lost all trust I had in you) / ________________________ / Name To Rid The Disease / Artist Opeth / Album Damnation"/>
