I can't see the meaning of this life I'm leading, I try to forget you as you forgot
Me, this time there is nothing left for you to take, this is goodbye

Summer is miles and miles away
And no one would ask me to stay

And I
Should contemplate this change
To ease the pain
And I
Should step out of the rain
Turn away

Close to ending it all I am drifting through the stages of the rapture born within
This loss, thoughts of death inside tear me apart from the core of my soul

Summer is miles and miles away
And no one would ask me to stay

And I
Should contemplate this change
To ease the pain
And I
Should step out of the rain
Turn away

At times the
Dark's fading slowly
But it never
Sustains
Would someone
Watch over me
In my time of
Need

Summer is miles and miles away
And no one would ask me to stay

And I
Should contemplate this change
To ease the pain
And I
Should step out of the rain
Turn away
