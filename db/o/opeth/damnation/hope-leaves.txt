In the corner
Beside my window
There hangs a lonely photograph
There is no reason
I'd never notice
A memory that could hold me back

There is a wound that's always bleeding
There is a road I'm always walking
And I know
You'll never return to this place

Gone through days
Without talking
There is a comfort
In silence
So used to losing
All ambition
Struggling to maintain what's left

There is a wound that's always bleeding
There is a road I'm always walking
And I know
You'll never return to this place

Once undone
There's only smoke
Burning in my eyes to blind
To cover up
What really happened
Force the darkness unto me

There is a wound that's always bleeding
There is a road I'm always walking
And I know you'll never return to this place
