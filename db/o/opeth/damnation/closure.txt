Heal myself
A feather on my heart
Look inside
There never was a start
Peel myself
Dispose of severed skin
All subsides
Around me and within

There's nothing painful in this
There's no upheaval
Redemption for my pathos
All sins undone

Awaiting
Word on what's to come
In helpless
Prayers a hope lives on
As I've come clean I've forgotten what I promised
In the rays of the sun
I am longing for the darkness
