There is a voice calling for me
There is a light coming down on me
There is a doubt that is clearing
There is a day that is dawning
There is a wound that is healing
There is a season waiting for me
There is a road that is turning
There is a fire still burning
A sickness in me
Constant pace towards the end
The need is stronger
This time the need is deeper
There is a peace I am searching
There is a freedom I'm depending on
There is a pain that's never ending
There is a rain falling only on me
There is a dream I am living
There is a life I'm dreaming of
There is a death I'm awaiting
There is a home I am deserting
I hold my breath and wait
Only moments remain
Movement for departed hope
Effect for absent friends
Sever the faith from my body
Leave me begging for more
Take what I have and deliver me
Into everlasting sleep
Soothing trance
Colours fade
And disappear
Ethereal light
Showing me what I can do without
In a motionless scene
There is only me
I take what I can
Controlling you to get ahead
Fading away
And leaving
Long for sleep
Closer now
Lead the way into death
Every wretched dream
I've left behind
Every waking hour
I lie in wait
Sucked inside by will
Gone into the flood
All my questions unfurled
As I was put to the test
Once I'm below there's no turning back
Plunging into the deepest void
Departed shell left drained behind
Pacing roads unknown
Searching for a new home
Desert in my eye
Barren lands inside
