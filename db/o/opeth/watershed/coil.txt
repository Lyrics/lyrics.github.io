She told me why she told me lies
Always take care of this
I told her how I've always stayed
Always waiting for nothing

When I get out of here
When I leave you behind
I'll find that the years passed us by

And I can see you
Riding through the fields of sorrow

When you get out of here
When you leave me behind
You'll find that the years passed us by

And I can see you
Riding through the fields of sorrow
