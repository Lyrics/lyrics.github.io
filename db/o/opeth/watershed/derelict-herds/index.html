    <div class="view"><pre>Someone died for looking too far
While I was asleep in my house
A child was killed, I heard it from a friend
A war raged in a distant land
Caused me to linger on a piece of text
Someone died
Not here, never here

There was a fever
There is a failure
Are you a believer?
Then someone lied to you

You hold it closer to your chest
There was a meaning for this test
But you forgot and it's gone now
You were controlled somehow

There was a mean time
An invitation of sorts
I remember life
I, I was sick with sorrow

I'd fallen asleep
And dreamt of my sins here
It was your turn
Adamant smile and said, "Thank you"

There was a sickness right in the family
While I shuddered in the cold
Woman hanged for her sins while I craved mine
An old man drowned in this life herd
As I made amends with my fathers

Someone died
Not here, never here</pre></div>
