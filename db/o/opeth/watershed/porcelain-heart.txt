I lost all I had (that April day)
I turned to my friends (nothing to say)
I wrote down a name (and read it twice)
I wallowed in shame...

I said that I loved (eternal schemes)
I cling to my past (like childish dreams)
I promised to stay (and held my breath)
I went far away...

Icy roads beneath my feet
Lead me through wastelands of deceit
Rest your head now - don't you cry
Don't ever ask the reason why

Kept inside our idle race
Ghost of an idol's false embrace
Rest your head now - don't you cry
Don't ever ask the reason why
