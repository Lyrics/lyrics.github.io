Majesty
Faithful me
Pour yourself
Into me
Wield your power
Martyr's price
Stare me down
To the ground

The eyes
Of the devil
Fixed on
His sinners

Slake my thirst
Eternal wealth
Heathen key
Round my neck
This poetry
Of blasphemy
Know the sounds
Of infamy

The hands
Of Satan
Assembling
His flock
Pale horse
Rider
Searching
The earth

Whispered conjuration, a belief takes form
Choking hand tapping the veins in your throat
His orders in your mouth, a decree for domination
Beneath the tides of wisdom, spins the undertow of hate
Injected seeds of vengeance, usurper's eyes of the powerless
Clean path to his kingdom beckoning in the mist

The grand conjuration

Tell me why
Love subsides
In the light
Of your wish
Say my name
Ease the pain
Clear the smoke
In my head
