Found a way
To rid myself clean of pain
And a fever that's
Been haunting me
Has gone away

Looking through my window
I seem to recognise
All the people passing by
But I'm alone
And far from home
Nobody knows me

Never heard me say goodbye
Never shall I speak to anyone again
All days are in darkness
And I'm biding my time
Once I am sure of my task I will rise
Again...
