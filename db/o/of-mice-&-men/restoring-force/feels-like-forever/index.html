<title>Of Mice & Men â€“ Feels Like Forever | Lyrics</title>
<meta name="description" content="Did you ever contemplate when all was lost you hesitate and nothing seems the same? / Have you ever hid your face, in such disgrace, decisions made, a picture with no frame? / Can you hold on? One more day? / Say you're okay, I'm afraid that tomorrow is just too far away. / Fight the pain, it just feels like forever is crashing down on me (down on me, me, me). / Rain will fall. Wash all the pain. It shields the soul, you turn the page to face another day. / Let me know that you will wait and I will pay for my mistakes to feel the sun again. / Can you hold on? / Say you're okay, I'm afraid that tomorrow is just too far away. / Fight the pain, it just feels like forever is crashing down on me. / Don't let go, time will heal. / Just don't let go, / One day we can try to start again. / Say you're okay, I'm afraid that tomorrow is just too far away. / Fight the pain, it just feels like forever, forever. / It feels like forever is crashing down on me (down on me, me, me). / ________________________ / Name Feels Like Forever / Artist Of Mice & Men / Album Restoring Force"/>
