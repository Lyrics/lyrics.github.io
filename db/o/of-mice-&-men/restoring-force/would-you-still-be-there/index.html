    <div class="view"><pre>If I could find the words
If I could shake the world
If I could turn back time
Would you still be there?

I can't stop thinking about the way
I left you sinking with no escape
Now there's no lifeline, no way to save
But maybe next time I won't throw it all away

I ask myself everyday

If I could find the words
If I could shake the world
If I could turn back time
Would you still be there? (Be there?)
If I could find the words to say
If I could shake the world to break you down
Then would you still be there? (Be there?)

(Would you still be there?)
(Would you still be there?)

Dislocated, I lie awake
Suffocating in my mistakes
I lost my halo when I fell from grace
But maybe next time I won't throw it all away

I ask myself everyday

If I could find the words
If I could shake the world
If I could turn back time
Would you still be there? (Be there?)
If I could find the words to say
If I could shake the world to break you down
Then would you still be there? (Would you still be there?)

There's no dancing around it
I crawl into the fire and fan the flames
And I can't stand it (And I can't stand it)
But I don't have the strength to burn the page

If I could find the words
If I could shake the world
If I could turn back time
Would you still be there? (Be there?)

If I could find the words (To say)
If I could shake the world (To break)
If I could turn back time
Would you still be there? (Be there?)
If I could find the words to say
If I could shake the world to break you down
Then would you still be there?

(Would you still be there?)</pre></div>
