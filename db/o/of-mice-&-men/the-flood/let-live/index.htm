<div><pre>I was all for you,
You fell over my love,
I just can't afford it this time.

Here's a story, just bare with me,
Met a drug that changed my life.
Something like a classic movie,
Just one look, all stopped with time.

Let her in through these very veins,
Coursing through these tired bones.
Numb my body, healed my heart,
Soothes my mind, and eased my soul.

These are the memories between us,
Let it go, and let live again.

I was all for you, you fell over my love,
I just can't afford it this time.
I was all for you, you fell over my love,
I just can't afford it this time.

You let me live, believing all your life.
You let me live your lie, live your lie.

You let me believe, and live your lie.

Guess I should have seen this coming,
Should have known it all along.
You're a fake, see clear right through you,
Left me dying, it's all your fault.

These are the memories between us,
Let it go, and let live again.

I was all for you, you fell over my love,
I just can't afford it this time.
I was all for you, you fell over my love,
I just can't afford it this time.

I gave you everything, and you just throw away.
Know what I deserve, know that I should let,
Let you go...;

Let you go!
This is me, letting you go...;

I was all for you, you fell over my love,
I just can't afford it this time.
I was all for you, you fell over my love,
Now I'm left with thoughts of suicide...;

Let you go, you're killing me.</pre></div>
