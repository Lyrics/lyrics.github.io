<title>Ohgr â€“ Chaos | Lyrics</title>
<meta name="description" content="Assisted paradigm entrusted privately decays / Behaving all controlled dependent look alike display / Affection for defection when no refuge all the same / Dependent never border one world order it away / Create a way / The mind will have to / Find a way / In guarding reason alibis / It seems a way / Defended reasons / It seems a way / It seems a way / Alarming visions / It seems a way / A begging man divine instructed shadow poverty / A deeply dirty hiding from too many eaten needs / Protection with selection cover all not needing anything / Resentment unrelenting change to self-destructive means / It seems a way / Poor execution / It seems a way / It seems a way / Each from a center / It seems a way / Addicted horrified abducted outwardly betray / Removing all below collective consciousness degrades / Ascension from depression which cover chosen all the same / Pretend it doesn't matter the world orders it away / Ask as if to find / Traces out of time / Back chews on itself / A turn that says it all / Inserting all the tools upon the broken talking dog / If fleeing dirty shadows off of drawings on the wall / A funded self of science from disorder and decay / Its chaos makes you crazy and the real is left to say / Its chaos makes you crazy and the real is left to say / Its chaos makes you crazy and the real is left to say / Its chaos makes you crazy and the real is left to say / Its chaos makes you crazy and the real is left to say / Its chaos makes you crazy and the real is left to say / Its chaos makes you crazy and the real is left to say / ___________________________ / Name chaos / Artist ohGr / Album weLt"/>
