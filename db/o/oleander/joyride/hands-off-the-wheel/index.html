    <div class="view"><pre>Don't, don't it make you sad
To lose the things you love
For what you never had?

Don't, don't it make you cry
To feel the broken time
And always wonder why?

Don't it make you feel like your hands are off the wheel,
Like your hands are off the wheel?
Don't it tear you down, don't it turn your world around,
Don't it love to let you down?

Don't, don't it make your day
To gather up your strength
And feel it slipping away?

How, how much can you take
Before you fall apart,
Before you start to break?

Don't it make you feel like your hands are off the wheel,
Like your hands are off the wheel?
Don't it tear you down, don't it turn your world around,
Don't it love to let you down?

Close your eyes, it's only no surprise you're not alone.

Don't it make you sad to lose the ones you love?

Don't it make you feel like your hands are off the wheel,
Like your hands are off the wheel?
Don't it tear you down, don't it turn your world around
Don't it love to let you down?

Don't it make you feel, don't it make you feel
Like it's carrying you down, down, down, down...
Like your hands are off the wheel,
Like your hands are off the wheel.</pre></div>
