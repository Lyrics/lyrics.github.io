In this society the opportunity to use your right free speech
Now an then is getting lost in clouds of tear gas
Is this the kind of government you are looking for?
Just close eyes but the injustice won't fade out

Get a move on
If that's what your democracy looks like...
We have got to move on

It is a tragedy, of this "democracy"
The goal:a positive change your answer is a punch in my face
Faced by unscrupulous cops beating us up, putting us in prison
We have to cut our losses. Fight back and that is our protest

But oppression breeds resistance and resistance is what we need
Despite police brutality we will defend our right to speak
We have got to fight for more
