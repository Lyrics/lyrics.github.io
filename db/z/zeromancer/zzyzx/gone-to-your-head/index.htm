<div><pre>It's on your mind (but you can't say it)
It's in your eyes (but you can't see it)
It's on your wrist (but you can't time it)
It's off the top of your head (but you can't wear it)

It's in your face
I's in your hands
It's in the air (but you can't breath it)
You're not the one I used to know

Gone to your head...

It's up your nose (but you can't snort it)
It's down your throat (but you can't suck it)
It's on your lap (but you can't have it)
It's in your reach (but you can't grab it)

It's in your face
I's in your hands
It's in the air (but you can't breath it)
You're not the one I used to know

And what if I said it's in your head?
You're not the one I used to know

And what if I said it's in your head?
You're not the one I used to know

Gone to your head...

Gone to your head...

Gone to your head...

(it's in your head)
(it's in your face)
(it's in your face)

And what if I said it's in your head?
You're not the one I used to know
And what if I said it's in your head?
You're not the one I used to know

And what if I said it's in your head?
You're not the one I used to know
And what if I said it's in your head?
You're not the one I used to know

Gone to your head...
