And watch me
I want you
To see me

As your TV (what's on?)
As your TV (what's on?)
As your TV (what's on?)
As your TV (what's on?)

Touched by
Your static
You see right
Right through me

As your TV (what's on?)
As your TV (what's on?)
As your TV (what's on?)
As your TV (what's on?)

What you hide is what you are,
What it takes to be a star, come on
You say there's beauty in a scar
Now what a stupid thing you are sometimes

After you get what you want you don't want it anymore
(is that what you want?)
After you get what you want you don't want it anymore
(is that what you want?)
After you get what you want you don't want it anymore
(is that what you want?)
After you get what you want you don't want it anymore

Slow down
Zoom in
Rewind
Do you get the picture?

Philharmonic
Philharmonic

As your TV (what's on?)
As your TV (what's on?)

What you hide is what you are,
What it takes to be a star, come on
You say there's beauty in a scar
Now what a stupid thing you are sometimes

Philharmonic

After you get what you want you don't want it anymore

Philharmonic

After you get what you want you don't want it anymore

Philharmonic

After you get what you want you don't want it anymore

Philharmonic

After you get what you want you don't want it anymore

(what's on?)

Philharmonic

(what's on?)

What you hide is what you are,
What it takes to be a star, come on (oh-on, oh-on)
You say there's beauty in a scar
Now what a stupid thing you are sometimes

What you hide is what you are,
What it takes to be a star, come on (oh-on, oh-on)
You say there's beauty in a scar
Now what a stupid thing you are sometimes
