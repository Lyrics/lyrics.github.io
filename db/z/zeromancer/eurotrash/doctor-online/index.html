It's the beginning of the end
You want things to go faster
It's the beginning of the end
Now everything's too slow for you

It's the beginning of the end
You are one step closer
It's the beginning of the end
Say Amen

1-800-SUICIDE
And maybe Doctor Online could help you die
You need wings to fly, you need someone
To take your place when you are gone

Is the beginning of the end
You know nothing lasts forever
A beginning of a trend
You need someone there to care for you

It's the beginning of the end
I don't think you understand
Just a beginning of a flatline
Together

And maybe Doctor Online could help you die
You need wings to fly, you need someone
To take your place when you are gone

1-800-SUICIDE
And maybe Doctor Online could help you die
You need wings to fly, you need someone
To take your place when you are gone
