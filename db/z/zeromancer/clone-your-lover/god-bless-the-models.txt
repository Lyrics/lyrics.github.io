Love, love, love
Makes you blind, blind
Lies, lies, lies
Tear you down

Plenty of time when you're dead
To be the perfect girl
There's plenty of room in your bed
To make a perfect world

Love, love, love
Makes you blind, blind
Lies, lies, lies
Tear you down

Out of a fucked up head
Comes a perfect girl
Out of a fucked up head
One perfect world

I want to fall a million floors
I'm gonna breathe through open pores
I'm gonna scream out open doors
God bless the models

Time, time, time
Makes you learn, learn
That love, love, love
You will have to earn

Out of a fucked up head
Comes a perfect word
Out of a fucked up head
Comes a perfect world

I want to fall a million floors
I'm gonna scream through open doors
You'll make the headlines when you die
God bless the models

Out of a fucked up head
(Comes a world of lust and greed)
Out of a fucked up head
(Comes a life of luxury)

Out of a fucked up head
(I'm gonna be there when you die)
Out of a fucked up head
(Don't cry)

God bless
The slave, slave, slave to fashion

God bless
The slave, slave, slave to fashion

God bless
The slave, slave, slave to fashion
