    <div class="view"><pre>How did it feel when it came alive and took you?
Out of the black
It broke your skin and shook through
Every part of me, every part of you

You made a fool out of me
And took the skin off my back running
So don't breathe when I talk
'Cause you haven't been spoken to

I got a gun for a mouth
And a bullet with your name on it
But a trigger for a heart
Beating blood from an empty pocket

I never knew why
And you didn't care when
You closed every door
And washed away no sin

And I promised you
Like you promised me
But those vows we made
Fucked them up for free, yeah

You made a fool out of me
And took the skin off my back running
So don't breathe when I talk
'Cause you haven't been spoken to

I got a gun for a mouth
And a bullet with your name on it
But a trigger for a heart
Beating blood from an empty pocket

You made a fool out of me
And took the skin off my back running
So don't breathe when I talk
'Cause you haven't been spoken to

I got a gun for a mouth
And a bullet with your name on it
But a trigger for a heart
Beating blood from an empty pocket

And it's hard, this world
Never lets you go
Deals a crooked hand</pre></div>
