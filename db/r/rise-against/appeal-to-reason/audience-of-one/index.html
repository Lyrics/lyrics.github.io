<title>Rise Against â€“ Audience Of One | Lyrics</title>
<meta name="description" content="I can still remember / The words and what they meant / As we etched them with our fingers / In years of wet cement / The days blurred into each other / Though everything seemed clear / We cruised along at half speed / But then we shifted gears / We ran like vampires from a thousand burning suns / But even then, we should have stayed / But we ran away / Now all my friends are gone / Maybe we've outgrown all the things that we once loved / Run away / But what are we running from? / A show of hands from those in this audience of one / Where have they gone? / Identities assume us / As nine and five add up / Synchronizing watches / With the seconds that we lost / And I looked up and saw you / I know that you saw me / We froze but for a moment / In empathy / I brought down the sky for you, but all you did was shrug / You gave my emptiness a name / And you ran away / Now all my friends are gone / Maybe we've outgrown all the things that we once loved / Run away / But what are we running from? / A show of hands from those in this audience of one / Where have they gone? / We're all OK, until the day we're not / The surface shines, while the inside rots / We raced the sunset and we almost won / We slammed the brakes, but the wheels went on / And we ran away / Now all my friends gone / Maybe we've outgrown all the things that we once loved / Run away / But what are we running from? / A show of hands from those in this audience of one / Where have they gone? / _____________________ / Name Audience Of One / Artist Rise Against / Album Appeal To Reason"/>
