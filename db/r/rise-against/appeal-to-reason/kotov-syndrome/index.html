<title>Rise Against â€“ Kotov Syndrome | Lyrics</title>
<meta name="description" content="They're high on the watchtower, / Keeping the peace...; / Whatever that means. / Because you see the world grow, / Crosshairs and TVs, don't you? / Ten foot walls built around us, / White picket death. / So quiet, so safe. / But if we fall there will be nothing, and no one to catch us. / Sit back and watch as we...; / Spin out of control, / Spin out of control, / Try to recover, but collide with each other. / We spin out of control, / (Hey!) / (Hey!) / (Hey!) / Something I can't change, / I was born in a place, / That lives by the sword. / And thus to it's blade we're condemned. / Don't you understand why we scream "no more."? (no more!) / My dreams are of children, / Orphaned by blood, / Spilt at these hands. / Here on the graves of the innocent, / We raise our flag. / Spin out of control, / Spin out of control, / Try to recover, but collide with each other. / We spin out of control. / (Hey!) / (Hey!) / (Hey!) / Some things you don't forgive, some things you don't forget. / Sometimes the fate you suffer is so much worse than death. / We're way off course now and we're drifting out to sea. / So cut the anchor on your heart to be set free, / Set free, / Set free! / Yeah. / Spin out of control, / Spin out of control, / Spin out of control, / Spin out of control. / Try to recover, we have to recover, / Before we crash, one after the other. / Spin out of control. / ____________________ / Name Kotov Syndrome / Artist Rise Against / Album Appeal To Reason"/>
