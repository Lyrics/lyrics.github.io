    <div class="view"><pre>They're high on the watchtower,
Keeping the peace...;
Whatever that means.
Because you see the world grow,
Crosshairs and TVs, don't you?

Ten foot walls built around us,
White picket death.
So quiet, so safe.
But if we fall there will be nothing, and no one to catch us.
Sit back and watch as we...;

Spin out of control,
Spin out of control,
Try to recover, but collide with each other.
We spin out of control,

(Hey!)
(Hey!)
(Hey!)

Something I can't change,
I was born in a place,
That lives by the sword.
And thus to it's blade we're condemned.
Don't you understand why we scream "no more."? (no more!)

My dreams are of children,
Orphaned by blood,
Spilt at these hands.
Here on the graves of the innocent,
We raise our flag.

Spin out of control,
Spin out of control,
Try to recover, but collide with each other.
We spin out of control.

(Hey!)
(Hey!)
(Hey!)

Some things you don't forgive, some things you don't forget.
Sometimes the fate you suffer is so much worse than death.
We're way off course now and we're drifting out to sea.
So cut the anchor on your heart to be set free,
Set free,
Set free!
Yeah.

Spin out of control,
Spin out of control,
Spin out of control,
Spin out of control.
Try to recover, we have to recover,
Before we crash, one after the other.
Spin out of control.</pre></div>
