We are the children you reject and disregard
These aching cries come from the bottom of our hearts
You can't disown us now, we are your own flesh and blood
And we don't disappear just because your eyes are shut, now tell me

Love, loss, like a bullet's path
Tear through the cavity of my chest
Lights out because the fuse has blown

As their castles crumble slowly (watch them fall)
We watch them fall (watch them fall)
The crown slips from heads unworthy (watch them fall)
As we gain control

This is the family that we crossed or never had
This is a war that was lost the day it began
Because it's the race we run, but it keeps us at the start
And it's the song I sung from the bottom of my heart, that's how we

Read you like a polygraph
Not one single bone in your back
Own up to how you let us down

As their castles crumble slowly (watch them fall)
We watch them fall (watch them fall)
The crown slips from heads unworthy (watch them fall)
As we gain control

Except for you and me, love
Everyone is the same, we know
We know, we know, we know

But if to live, we have to be numb
I'd rather know the pain
I'd rather know, I'd rather know

This happens almost never
But it happened once to me
And this will never be same

The ends we seam together

I'm not after fame and fortune
I'm after you
When I've served my time
I swear I will come back for you

(Watch them fall...)

As their castles crumble slowly (watch them fall)
We watch them fall (watch them fall)
The crown slips from heads unworthy
Right on to ours, but I'm after you
But I'm after you
I'm after you
And I'm after you
