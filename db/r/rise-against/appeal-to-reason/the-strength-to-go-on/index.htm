<div><pre>Welcome home
While away
They have tampered with the locks
And your things they rearranged

We propose,  a better way
Said the note they left behind
In their wake of disarray
You fell in place

Don't fall asleep
They'll find us here
I know a place, to disappear
As a voice proclaimed

What we are is the sum of a thousand lies
What we know is almost nothing at all
But we are what we are 'til the day we die
Or 'til we don't have the strength to go on
'Til we don't have the strength to go on

Let us cry
Let us be
Let us open up our hearts
Without fear of anything

Faith alone
Is all we need
To traverse this burning bridge
Now before it gets too late
You claim "it's fine"

But the heart reveals
What smiles betray
Your sad sad eyes gave you away
And don't you know

What we are is the sum of a thousand lies
What we know is almost nothing at all
But we are what we are 'til the day we die
Or 'til we don't have the strength to go on
'Til we don't have the strength to go on

Our shoulders bear an awful weight
But still we trudge on just the same
Our colors run then leave a stain

They blacken our once honest name
How can we argue, tell me
Over the fury and the fire
How many times can we tell you that we
Are not like you, we see right through
Your poor disguise that fails to fool
The wary eye that is trained on you

What we are is the sum of a thousand lies
What we know is almost nothing at all
But we are what we are 'til the day we die
Or 'til we don't have the strength to go on
'Til we don't have the strength to go on

What we are is the sum of a thousand lies
What we know is almost nothing at all
But we are what we are 'til the day we die
Or 'til we don't have the strength to go on
'Til we don't have the strength to go on</pre></div>
