    <div class="view"><pre>To the ends of this lost world
You have marched and you have sworn
To a tainted crown of thorns

As the hungry sails unfurl
We are thrusted from the shore
And it's you that we search for

The blackest night
The midnight sun
The covered tracks
And days spent on the run
The strangers we've become

These whereabouts unknown
Please know you can come home
It's alright
I long for the moment
Our silence is broken
It's alright
It's alright
It's alright...

Another place, another time
We toed the same side of the line
Yeah, we saw eye to eye

Even then the saddest sounds
Were nothing laughter could not drown
But we are not laughing now

I see your face
In my sights
I hesitate
And then look for a sign
Somewhere in the sky

These whereabouts unknown
Please know you can come home
It's alright
I long for the moment
Our silence is broken
It's alright
It's alright
It's alright...

Even together, we stand apart
Swallow the sun, erase the sky
An invitation that's been declined
Where did you go?
Where did you go?

Your whereabouts unknown
Please know you can come home
It's alright
I long for the moment
Our silence is broken
It's alright
It's alright
It's alright

It's alright now

It's alright yeah
'Cause all is forgiven
If you could just listen....
It's alright
It's alright...</pre></div>
