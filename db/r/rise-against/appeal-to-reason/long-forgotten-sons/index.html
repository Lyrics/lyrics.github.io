    <div class="view"><pre>Far from home on a road unknown
Where the vultures circle on winds that blow
From northern skies that haunt these waking moments
On shadows cast by the mountain range
On calloused soles we find our way
Through desperate eyes, we long for the horizon
While this sun is rising

We are the long forgotten sons
And daughters that don't belong to anyone
We are alone under this sun
We work to fix the work that you've undone

When cries for help go unanswered
And signal fires just burn and burn
We wonder if we're waiting here for nothing
'Cause our lips are sewn our ears are filled
With the constant drone of the unfulfilled
But we'll never fall if we stand for something
We stand for something

We are the long forgotten sons
And daughters that don't belong to anyone
We are alone under this sun
We work to fix the work that you've undone

Don't fall, I see lights in the distance
They're not far away
Stand up because the sky is turning gray

There's hope in these footsteps of persistence
So don't go astray
These lights get closer everyday

We are the long forgotten sons
Yeah, we are the long forgotten sons

We are the long forgotten sons
And daughters that don't belong to anyone
We are alone under this sun
We work to fix the work that you've undone
What you've undone
(What happens now, we don't know, just hold on tight now here we go...;)</pre></div>
