<title>Rise Against â€“ Long Forgotten Sons | Lyrics</title>
<meta name="description" content="Far from home on a road unknown / Where the vultures circle on winds that blow / From northern skies that haunt these waking moments / On shadows cast by the mountain range / On calloused soles we find our way / Through desperate eyes, we long for the horizon / While this sun is rising / We are the long forgotten sons / And daughters that don't belong to anyone / We are alone under this sun / We work to fix the work that you've undone / When cries for help go unanswered / And signal fires just burn and burn / We wonder if we're waiting here for nothing / 'Cause our lips are sewn our ears are filled / With the constant drone of the unfulfilled / But we'll never fall if we stand for something / We stand for something / We are the long forgotten sons / And daughters that don't belong to anyone / We are alone under this sun / We work to fix the work that you've undone / Don't fall, I see lights in the distance / They're not far away / Stand up because the sky is turning gray / There's hope in these footsteps of persistence / So don't go astray / These lights get closer everyday / We are the long forgotten sons / Yeah, we are the long forgotten sons / We are the long forgotten sons / And daughters that don't belong to anyone / We are alone under this sun / We work to fix the work that you've undone / What you've undone / (What happens now, we don't know, just hold on tight now here we go...;) / _________________________ / Name Long Forgotten Sons / Artist Rise Against / Album Appeal To Reason"/>
