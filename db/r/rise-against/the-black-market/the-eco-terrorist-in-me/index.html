    <div class="view"><pre>Spray paint the cameras, jam the frequency,
What you kill, just comes alive in me,
Hoods and bandanas make not an enemy,
You can't define us, any way you please!

You make the rules, we make the calls
My conscience clean, my sins absolved

Because I found God (hey!)
In the sound of your factories burning down,
Now I sleep so sound...

When it all comes down, will you say you did everything you could?
When it all comes down, can you say that you never gave up?
Were you standing by to watch it fall away?
Will you hold on or let go?

Instead of doing what's right they built higher walls
Where we can't shed a light on true criminals
When business and suffering is one and the same
When laws fail the people, they turn to the flame

I found love (love!)
I found life (life!)
As a thorn stuck in your side,
And you wonder why...

When it all comes down, will you say you did everything you could?
When it all comes down, can you say that you never gave up?
Were you standing by, to watch it fall away?

Will you hold up? Did you hold up? Or just let it fall?
Did you let it fall?

When it all comes down, will you say you did everything you could?
When it all comes down, can you say that you never gave up?
When it all comes down, will you say you did everything you could?

When it all comes down,
When it all comes down...

When the lights all go out, and roadblocks go up,
As we sleep to the sound of alarms going off
When it all comes down, will you say you did everything you could?</pre></div>
