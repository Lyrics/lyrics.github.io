<title>Rise Against â€“ Bridges | Lyrics</title>
<meta name="description" content="In a world of uncertainty / The night sky told us all to be patient / But when the ground started shaking / I wondered for how long / There's a place that I'd rather be / There's a voice deep inside of me / Saying the progress we are making / Is not progress at all / Into a world of promises, whoa / Is where we let ourselves been led / We built the bridges / We now sleep under / We frame the door ways / But may not pass through / The very same roads / That we now wander / Ones you pass us by on / We paved with our bare hands / Paved with our bare hands / A black cloud hovers over me / Without all this guilt I feel naked / Something about the way it / Wraps its arms around / White snow covers everything / An angel watches over me / Praying, she asks me for a favor / Catch me if I fall / A rush of blood straight to the head, whoa / I wonder what this could have been / We built the bridges / We now sleep under / We frame the door ways / But may not pass through / The very same roads / That we now wander / Ones you pass us by on / We paved with our bare hands / Paved with our bare hands / Hey! / No I never meant to hurt you / No I never meant to do you wrong / I stood waiting while the man said move along / We lay the tracks down / But now they rotted / Like a runaway train / We brace for the crash / We were in love once / Have you forgotten? / Like a runaway train / Bearing down upon a gap / We built the bridges (brace for the crash) / (Built from their hypocrisy) / We built the bridges (brace for the crash) / (and now we brace for the crash) / We built the bridges (brace for the crash) / (Built from their hypocrisy) / We built the bridges (brace for the crash) / And underneath the shadows we now live / _____________ / Name Bridges / Artist Rise Against / Album The Black Market"/>
