    <div class="view"><div id="lyrics">In a world of uncertainty
The night sky told us all to be patient
But when the ground started shaking
I wondered for how long

There's a place that I'd rather be
There's a voice deep inside of me
Saying the progress we are making
Is not progress at all

Into a world of promises, whoa
Is where we let ourselves been led

We built the bridges
We now sleep under
We frame the door ways
But may not pass through

The very same roads
That we now wander
Ones you pass us by on
We paved with our bare hands
Paved with our bare hands

A black cloud hovers over me
Without all this guilt I feel naked
Something about the way it
Wraps its arms around
White snow covers everything
An angel watches over me
Praying, she asks me for a favor
Catch me if I fall

A rush of blood straight to the head, whoa
I wonder what this could have been

We built the bridges
We now sleep under
We frame the door ways
But may not pass through

The very same roads
That we now wander
Ones you pass us by on
We paved with our bare hands
Paved with our bare hands
Hey!

No I never meant to hurt you
No I never meant to do you wrong
I stood waiting while the man said move along

We lay the tracks down
But now they rotted
Like a runaway train
We brace for the crash

We were in love once
Have you forgotten?
Like a runaway train
Bearing down upon a gap

We built the bridges (brace for the crash)
(Built from their hypocrisy)
We built the bridges (brace for the crash)
(and now we brace for the crash)
We built the bridges (brace for the crash)
(Built from their hypocrisy)
We built the bridges (brace for the crash)
And underneath the shadows we now live</div></div>
