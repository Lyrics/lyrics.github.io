<title>Rise Against â€“ A Beautiful Indifference | Lyrics</title>
<meta name="description" content="There's a struggle coming, but to conquer, first they must divide / The machines keep humming night and day / How are we so unaware / Why are you not afraid? / Protests are drumming while you turn your nose and roll your eyes / Knee-jerk reactions so ingrained / Judging from an arm chair / Cause there is hate and there is love and there is loss / But there is light and there is dark, then there is us / And whether this world burns, is none of your concern / Caught up in a ticker-tape parade / I have learned to stand up and just to walk away / Sometimes the cold hearts aren't worth the love or the hate / Learn to let go, learn to walk away / Up from the shadows I'm seduced by the light of the flame / But this time I'm here to stay / Gunpowder residue, bright lights and turpentine / True colors shining through, as we are stripped of our exteriors / Now, cause there is hate and there is love and there is loss / But there is right and there is wrong, then there is us / We're falling until / We learn to stand up and just to walk away / Sometimes the cold hearts aren't worth the love or the hate / Learn to let go, learn to walk away / Up from the shadows I'm seduced by the light of the flame / But this time I'm here to stay / Feet first into the quicksand, every day we are surrendering / Never straying from the game plan / I keep hoping you will take my hand and stand up / The water's overflowing, the walls are breaking / But I know where I'm going, that we can make it / And there's a light still glowing and I will chase it / And I've been lost before and I have been led astray / But this time I'm here to stay / ______________________________ / Name A Beautiful Indifference / Artist Rise Against / Album The Black Market"/>
