<div><pre>There's a fire on the borders and it's burning down the walls you built high
There's a steady stream of anger and it's spilling from the coasts
A tidal wave
And the words say we reap what we sow
So where I bury you I'll build my home
In line to reclaim but we're sick of the wait

We want it all and we want it now
Tonight I watched your fires burn out
The cold dead hands we pried these guns from are yours, woah

We want it all and we want it now
A tide is coming to drown you out
We make ourselves at home
While your body's still warm, woah

Go
Tradition tethers us to rituals and are we all just clocks on the wrong times?
And something triggers each and every time I hear you say
"God bless this place"

But your numbers are dwindling now
Though endangered we'll still hunt you down
With heads on a stake
Long may you reign

We want it all and we want it now
Tonight I watched your fires burn out
The cold dead hands we pried these guns from are yours, woah

We want it all and we want it now
A tide is coming to drown you out
We make ourselves at home
While your body's still warm, woah yeah

There's a fire on the borders and it's burning down the walls you built high
And there's a steady stream of anger and it's spilling from the coasts
A tidal wave

We want the mother fucking world
And we want it now
Tonight I watched your fires burn out
The cold dead hands we pried these guns from are yours, woah yeah

No I don't wanna wait
I know a better way
So step aside come on
Or better yet just go away
Our chance has finally come
There might not be another one

Now
No we're not gonna wait
We want it now
Yeah, we're dousing the flames
We want it now</pre></div>
