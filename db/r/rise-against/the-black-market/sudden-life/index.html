<title>Rise Against â€“ Sudden Life | Lyrics</title>
<meta name="description" content="Floating in the clouds, I'm giving up the fight / A voice is calling out, I'm walking into the light / We used to race a thousand miles a day so fast / Feet they barely even touched the ground / We used to fly to places out beyond our own little world / The fury and the sound / I saw it flicker like a television set / Bright flashes of a warning sign / Flipping channels in a world gone static / Eroding away line by fading line / Underwater for years we found / So much harder to swim than drown / The current takes us now we're walking into the light / Are you dying all your life? / (Walking into the light) / Broken, beat, and tired out / (Walking into the light) / You want to live but don't know how / (Walking into the light) / Diagnosis: Sudden life / (Walking into the light) / Can no one revive me now? / Feels like I'm walking into the light / Woke up floating on a wave of golden sound / Tunnel vision and a great beyond / Heart beating like a rhythm slowing / Down til it's gone an echo of a song / Flat line and a closing bell whisper a warm farewell / The flames are beckoning as we're walking into the light / Are you dying all your life? / (Walking into the light) / Broken, beat, and tired out / (Walking into the light) / You want to live but don't know how / Diagnosis: Sudden life / (Walking into the light) / Can no one revive me now? / Feels like I'm walking into the light / Don't suppose that you know the way? / Don't suppose that you care? / I see lights up ahead and / Hear choirs of angels ring in my ears / But you know that had you a choice / You would go back do it again / We all have unfinished business to tend / So no I won't go gentle into that good night / You can keep your candle / I'm walking away from the light / Yeah, I'm walking away from the light / I'm walking away from the light / I'm walking away from the light / Now I'm walking away from the light / Diagnosis: Sudden life / (Walking away from the light) / I woke up my heart racing / (Walking away from the light) / I'm at a loss explaining why / (Walking away from the light) / Are you dying all your life / (Walking away from the light) / Then put your darkest days behind / Let life flash right before your eyes / And for the very first time / It feels like I'm walking away from the light / _________________ / Name Sudden Life / Artist Rise Against / Album The Black Market"/>
