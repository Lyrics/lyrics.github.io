<div><pre>On the edges of the sharpest knives
In the middle of the darkest nights
Always knew that I would find you here
In a puddle of the bravest tears

I've seen enough to know it's lonely where you are
Above the crowd
Feet dangling from a rooftop (a rooftop)
She waits from ledges for a voice to talk her down

Nothing matters but the pain when you're alone
Never-ending nights when you're awake
When you're praying that tomorrow it's okay
There will be a time to crack another smile
Maybe not today or for a while
But we're holding on to laugh again some day
To laugh again some day

All that matters is the time we had
Doesn't matter how it all went bad
Never wonder what it might be like
Shut the door, say goodbye

When faced with tragedy
We come alive or come undone
So don't hold back, let it shape you like an ocean
Even the deepest scars in time will fade

Nothing matters but the pain when you're alone
Never-ending nights when you're awake
When you're praying that tomorrow it's okay
There will be a time to crack another smile
Maybe not today or for a while
But we're holding on to laugh again some day
Yeah, we're holding on to laugh again some day

And sometimes you have to go back
To know just where you were then
But we're old enough to know that
What has been, will be again and again

And the bravest of faces are the ones where we fake it
And the roles that we play

Nothing matters when the pain is all but gone
When you are finally awake
Despite the overwhelming odds, tomorrow came

And when they see you crack a smile
And you decide to stay a while
You'll be ready then, to laugh again

Nothing matters but the pain
(We are tragedy, yeah, we are sympathy)
Nothing matters but the pain
You see what you want to see

Nothing matters but the pain
(We are misery, a distant memory)
Nothing matters but the pain
We all learned to laugh again
Yeah, we all learned to laugh again
We all learned to laugh again</pre></div>
