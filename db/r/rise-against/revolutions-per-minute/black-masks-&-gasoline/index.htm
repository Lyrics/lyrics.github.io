<div><pre>Simply because you can breathe
Doesn't mean you're alive
Or that you really live
This life has taken its toll
And she just doesn't know
How much more she can give

But here, at the top of the world
Where I raise my hands and I clench my fists
They stand before me below
Demanding the answers with flips of a switch

I don't understand where you got this idea
So deeply engrained in your head
(That this world) Is something that you must impress
Because I couldn't care less

A need for revolution's rising
It comes to the surface, gasping for air
We're not putting up with this planet
One more day, much less one more year

I don't understand where you got this idea
So deeply engrained in your head
(That this world) Is something that you must impress
Because I couldn't care less

So here and now, in our rotting nation
The blood, it pours, it's all on our hands now
We live in fear of our own potential
To win, to lose, it's all on our hands now

I have an American Dream
But it involves black masks and gasoline
One day I'll turn these thoughts into screams
At a world that turned its back down on me

I don't understand where you got this idea
So deeply engrained in your head
(That this world) Is something that you must impress
'Cause I couldn't care less</pre></div>
