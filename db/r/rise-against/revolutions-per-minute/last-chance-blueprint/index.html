Late nights and bloodshot eyes
Clock ticking half past five
We're barely breathing but we're still alive
Go!

Our plans are all laid out
Take all these unmarked roads
We blaze the trails to places no one goes
Yeah!

One last chance to go
If I don't leave tonight I never will
Let's go!
One last chance to go
Let's take it now, in for the kill

In time we find ourselves
Back where we started from
Too weak to fight and much too tired to run
Yeah!

Before you swallow me
Into your perfect life
I'm not going out without a fight

One last chance to go
If I don't leave tonight I never will
Let's go!
One last chance to go
Let's take it now, in for the kill

(If I had to leave tonight would you come with me?)
(What?)
(If I had to go to New York, and live, tonight, would you come with me?)

But this blueprint's faded grey
And here it seems like just yesterday
When we mapped out the details of our great escape

But still these roads all beckon me
To uncover their mystery
But I fall like dead autumn leaves
And let the jetstream carry me

One last chance to go
If I don't leave tonight I never will
Let's go!
One last chance to go</pre></div>
