They turn the lights down low
In shadows hiding from the world
Only coming out when it gets cold

The seas part when they hit the floor
The voices carry on and out the door
And everything you touch turns into gold

Like the angel you are
You laugh, creating a lightness in my chest
Your eyes, they penetrate me
Your answer's always 'maybe'
That's when I got up and left

A beating heart, a microphone
A ticking clock in an empty home
Still tells of these times so long ago

And even though I've come so far
I know I've got so far to go
And any day now I'll explode

Like the angel you are
You laugh, creating a lightness in my chest
Your eyes, they penetrate me
Your answer's always 'maybe'
That's when I got up and left

And each and everyday, we'll lead into tomorrow
Tomorrow brings one less day without you
But don't wait up, just leave the light on
'Cause all the roads that I might take
Will all one day lead back to you

And like the angel you are
You laugh, creating a lightness in my chest
Your eyes, they penetrate me
Never ceases to amaze
That's when I got up and left
