If I could paint how I feel
I'd draw bullseye on your forehead
My anger is not misdirected
Unless it somehow misses you

Time spent on hate
Is time gone to waste
I watch you point and click your life away

Cast the stones that I'll gladly catch
And I'll throw them right fucking back
I stand behind the things I say
You type the words you won't say to my face

Time spent on hate
Is time gone to waste
I watch you point and click your life away

It seems you've let me go again (Let go!)
Just like the day you let me in (Let go!)
The best of intentions
You were never mine to begin, begin with

So step away from the fucking screen
See a world outside your scene
Maybe then you will know
And realize the lack of threat you pose
