Can you hear
The desperate cries that are calling out your name
Twisting your arm
Holding out their hands and tugging at your sleeve

Do you feel
This underlying sense of urgency
Or are you as blind as me?

I hit the ground and I'm still running
But I need a place to stay tonight
I swear I'll be gone in the morning
I just need somewhere now

I can't bear the thought of losing
I dread the attention winning brings
And ever since the day I came here
I can stand without your strings

I'm so sick of all these people
But I'm scared to be alone
And if this life has taught me anything
I forgot it long ago

And so I hit the ground and I'm still running
But I need a place to stay tonight
I swear I'll be gone in the morning
I just need somewhere warm to close my eyes

Hit the ground and I'm still running
But I need a place to stay tonight
I swear I'll be gone in the morning
I just need somewhere warm to close my eyes

The heart is something
You can't control
We either choose to follow
Or be left on our own

So we're leaving here on
Our less-traveled road
As our desperate cries grow louder
I know we're getting close, getting close

And so I hit the ground and I'm still running
But I need a place to stay tonight
I swear I'll be gone in the morning
I just need somewhere warm to close my eyes

Hit the ground and I'm still running
But I need a place to stay tonight
I swear I'll be gone in the morning
I just need somewhere warm to close my eyes
