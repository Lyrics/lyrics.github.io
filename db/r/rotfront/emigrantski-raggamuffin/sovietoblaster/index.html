    <div class="view"><pre>The wheels go round, the beat goes faster
It's my favourite tune on the Sovietoblaster!
And everyone here drinks vodka and beer
And the dancing queen of Kiev, Ukraine
Drives every boy insane!

A crazy professor
With a bag full of food
His 18-year old daughter
(She looks so good!)
A fat businessman
With a unique hairstyle
A contract killer -
(You have to see him smile!)

He's so proud of his gun
Showing it to everyone
On his mobilephone
He's got a picture of his son
There's a mormon preacher -
Black suit and a tie
The train left the station
Kiev, goodbye!
Let's introduce ourselves - we're sitting on a train
That takes us to Berlin from Ukraine

The wheels go round, the beat goes faster
It's my favourite tune on the Sovietoblaster!
And everyone here drinks vodka and beer
And the dancing queen of Kiev, Ukraine
Drives every boy insane!

From Ukraine with love
I'm like a spy on a mission in a
Palace on wheels
With no air conditioner
It's hot as hell
But we don't care
We have two days
And one night to spare
Our small compartment's
Like a telephone cell
Everyone here
Has stories to tell
We are in no hurry
We've got plenty of time
Tell me your lifestory
I'll tell you mine

Another round of drinks
Now take out your guitar
There's a party
In the dining car!

I once used to live here
Now I came back
For these old soviet records
Now they are all in my bag -
Dozens of vinyls
As heavy as bricks
Bringing death to DJs
With all their tricks!

Forget your Top 10!
I've got some LPs
That are 100 times funkier
Than Black Eyed Peas!
Crazy balalaikas from
Nineteen Sixty-Five!
You've been dreaming to hear it
All of your life!

When there's no wodka left
What shall we do, my friends?
Lets forget our troubles
And DANCE!</pre></div>
