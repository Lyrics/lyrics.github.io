    <div class="view"><pre>Uh!

The movie ran through me
The glamor subdued me
The tabloid untied me
I'm empty, please fill me

Mister anchor assure me
That Baghdad is burning
Your voice it is so soothing
That cunning mantra of killing

I need you, my witness
To dress this up so bloodless
To numb me and purge me now
Of thoughts of blaming you

Yes, the car is our wheelchair
My witness, your coughing
Oily silence mocks the legless ones
Who travel now in coffins

On the corner (corner, corner, corner)
The jury's sleepless (sleepless, sleepless, sleepless)
We found your weakness (weakness, weakness, weakness)
And it's right outside your door

Now testify
Now testify
It's right outside your door
Now testify
Yes testify
It's right outside your door

With precision, you feed me
My witness, I'm hungry
Your temple, it calms me
So I can carry on

My slaving, sweating
The skin right off my bones
On a bed of fire, I'm choking
On the smoke that fills my home

The wrecking ball is rushing
Witness, your blushing
The pipeline is gushing
While here we lie in tombs

While on the corner (corner, corner, corner)
The jury's sleepless (sleepless, sleepless, sleepless)
We found your weakness (weakness, weakness, weakness)
And it's right outside your door

Now testify
Yeah, testify
It's right outside your door
Now testify
Now testify
When it's right outside your door

Mass graves for the pump and the price is set
And the price is set
Mass graves for the pump and the price is set
And the price is set
Mass graves for the pump and the price is set
And the price is set
Mass graves for the pump and the price is set
And the price is set

Who controls the past now, controls the future
Who controls the present now, controls the past
Who controls the past now, controls the future
Who controls the present now?

Now testify
Testify
It's right outside your door
Now testify
Testify
It's right outside your door</pre></div>
