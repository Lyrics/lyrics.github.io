We're the renegades of this atomic age
This atomic age of renegades
Renegades of this atomic age
This atomic age of renegades

Since the prehistoric ages and the days of ancient Greece
On down through the Middle Ages
Planet earth kept going through changes
And then the renaissance came
And times continued to change
Nothing stayed the same, but there were always renegades
Like Chief Sitting Bull, Tom Paine
Doctor Martin Luther King, Malcolm X
They were renegades of their time and age
So many renegades

We're the Renegades of Funk
We're the Renegades of Funk
We're the Renegades of Funk
We're the Renegades of Funk

From a different solar system many many galaxies away
We are the force of another creation
A new musical revelation
And we're on this musical mission to help the others listen
And groove from land to land singing electronic chants like
Zulu nation
Revelation
Destroy all nations
Destroy all nations
Destroy all nations
Destroy all nations
Destroy all nations
Destroy all nations

Now renegades are people with their own philosophies
They change the course of history
Everyday people like you and me
We're the renegades, we're the people with our own philosophies
We change the course of history
Everyday people like you and me c'mon!

We're the Renegades of Funk
We're the Renegades of Funk
We're the Renegades of Funk
We're the Renegades of Funk

We're poppin', sockin', rockin' put a side of hip-hop
Because where we're goin' there ain't no stoppin'
Poppin', sockin', rockin' put a side of hip-hop
Because where we're goin' there ain't no stoppin'
Poppin', an' sockin', an' rockin', an puttin' a side of hip-hop
Because we're, poppin', sockin', rockin' put a side of hip-hop
Poppin', sockin', rockin' put a side of hip-hop

We're the Renegades of Funk
We're the Renegades of Funk
We're the Renegades of Funk
We're the Renegades of Funk

We're teachers of the funk
And not of empty popping
We're blessed with the Force and the sight of electronics
With the bass, and the treble
The horns and our vocals
'Cause everytime we pop into the beat we get fresh

C'mon

There was a time when our music
Was something called the big street beat
People would gather from all around
To get down to the big sound
You had to be a renegade those days
To take a man on the dance floor

Say jam sucka (jam sucka)
Say jam sucka (jam sucka)
Say groove, sucka (groove sucka)
Now groove, sucka (groove sucka)
Say dance, sucka (dance sucka)
Say dance, sucka (dance sucka)
Say move, sucka (move sucka)
Now move, sucka (move sucka)

Say jam sucka (jam sucka)
Say jam sucka (jam sucka)
Say groove, sucka (groove sucka)
Now groove, sucka (groove sucka)
Say dance, sucka (dance sucka)
Say dance, sucka (dance sucka)
Say move, sucka (move sucka)
Now move, sucka (move sucka)

We're the Renegades of Funk
We're the Renegades of Funk
We're the Renegades of Funk
We're the Renegades of Funk
We're the Renegades of Funk
We're the Renegades of Funk
We're the Renegades of Funk
We're the Renegades of Funk</pre></div>
