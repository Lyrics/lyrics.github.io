<br/><span></span>I wish I would've known
<br/><span></span>Cause I would've kissed my mama goodbye<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>I didn't tell her that I loved her and how much I care
<br/><span></span>Or thank my pops for all the talks
<br/><span></span>And all the wisdom he shared<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>Unaware, I just did what I always do
<br/><span></span>Everyday, the same routine
<br/><span></span>Before I skate off to school<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>But who knew that this day wasn't like the rest
<br/><span></span>Instead of taking a test
<br/><span></span>I took two to the chest<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>Call me blind, but I didn't see it coming
<br/><span></span>Everybody was running
<br/><span></span>But I couldn't hear nothing<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>Except gun blasts, it happened so fast
<br/><span></span>I didn't really know this kid
<br/><span></span>He wasn't part of the class<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>Maybe this kid was reaching out for love
<br/><span></span>Or maybe for a moment
<br/><span></span>He forgot who he was<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>Or maybe this kid just wanted to be hugged
<br/><span></span>Whatever it was
<br/><span></span>I know it's because<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>We are, we are, the youth of the nation
<br/><span></span>We are, we are, youth of the nation
<br/><span></span>We are, we are, the youth of the nation
<br/><span></span>We are, we are, youth of the nation<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>Little Suzy, she was only twelve
<br/><span></span>She was given the world
<br/><span></span>With every chance to excel<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>Hang with the boys and hear the stories they tell
<br/><span></span>She might act kind of proud
<br/><span></span>But no respect for herself<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>She finds love in all the wrong places
<br/><span></span>The same situations
<br/><span></span>Just different faces<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>Changed up her pace since her daddy left her
<br/><span></span>Too bad he never told her
<br/><span></span>She deserved much better<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>Johnny boy always played the fool
<br/><span></span>He broke all the rules
<br/><span></span>So you would think he was cool<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>He was never really one of the guys
<br/><span></span>No matter how hard he tried
<br/><span></span>Often thought of suicide<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>It's kind of hard when you ain't got no friends
<br/><span></span>He put his life to an end
<br/><span></span>They might remember him then<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>You cross the line and there's no turning back
<br/><span></span>Told the world how he felt
<br/><span></span>With the sound of a gat<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>We are, we are, the youth of the nation
<br/><span></span>We are, we are, youth of the nation
<br/><span></span>We are, we are, the youth of the nation
<br/><span></span>We are, we are, youth of the nation<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>Who's to blame for the lives that tragedies claim
<br/><span></span>No matter what you say
<br/><span></span>It don't take away the pain<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>That I feel inside, I'm tired of all the lies
<br/><span></span>Don't nobody know why
<br/><span></span>It's the blind leading the blind<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>I guess that's the way the story goes
<br/><span></span>Will it ever make sense
<br/><span></span>Somebody's got to know<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>There's got to be more to life than this
<br/><span></span>There's got to be more to everything
<br/><span></span>I thought exists<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>We are, we are, the youth of the nation
