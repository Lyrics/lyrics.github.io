There's a war inside my head<br/>I found a lion hidden right beneath my bed<br/>I will not hide myself from the tears that you have shed<br/>'Cause I am a lion and you are dead</p><p>Here's a story of everything we'll ever be<br/>You can hide but some of us can never leave<br/>And if you go I don't need those little things<br/>That remind me of all our little dreams<br/>Can you hear the words? All I can say<br/>We can watch the world, even if they walk away<br/>Forget about tomorrow, tomorrow is today<br/>You were born a lion and a lion you will stay</p><p>I am a lion and I want to be free<br/>Do you see a lion when you look inside of me?<br/>Outside the window just to watch you as you sleep<br/>'Cause I am a lion born from things you cannot be</p><p>Remember an army of all those little kids?<br/>Living life like they only get a little bit<br/>It's hard to fight when you're born in the middle and<br/>I'd rather die, won't watch you givin' in<br/>I'm sorry daughter but your father's not the same<br/>I can look into your eyes and I swear that I will change<br/>But tomorrow is tomorrow so forgive me if I stay<br/>You can hide beneath the covers while I hide behind the pain</p><p>After all, only so much we can say<br/>Words can lose their meaning once you walk away<br/>Promise that you'll love me, watch me as I fade<br/>I'll give you all those things that these liars never gave<br/>The hands on the clock and the things we cannot change<br/>Tear it all to pieces and take back what I made<br/>If there's one thing I'd keep, it's you that I would save<br/>'Cause I am just a lion and a lion I will stay</p><p>I am a lion and I want to be free<br/>Do you see a lion when you look inside of me?<br/>Outside the window just to watch you as you sleep<br/>'Cause I am a lion born from things you cannot be</p><p>Hey, I never meant to let go<br/>All I want and you're all I ever wanna know<br/>Can't hide in the attic of a pretty home<br/>Of a pretty home, of a pretty home<br/>Hey, I never meant to let go<br/>All I want and you're all I ever wanna know<br/>Can't hide in the attic of a pretty home<br/>Of a pretty home, of a pretty home</p><p>Hey</p><p>I am a lion and I want to be free<br/>Do you see a lion when you look inside of me?<br/>Outside the window just to watch you as you sleep<br/>'Cause I am a lion born from things you cannot be</p></article></div>
