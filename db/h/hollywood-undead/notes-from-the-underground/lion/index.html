    <div class="view"><pre>I am a lion and I want to be free
Do you see a lion when you look inside of me?
Outside the window just to watch you as you sleep
'Cause I am a lion born from things you cannot be

How can I sleep at night? There's a war inside my head
I found a lion hidden right beneath my bed
I will not hide myself from the tears that you have shed
'Cause I am a lion and you are dead

Here's a story of everything we'll ever be
You can hide but some of us can never leave
And if you go I don't need those little things
That remind me of all our little dreams
Can you hear the words? All I can say
We can watch the world, even if they walk away
Forget about tomorrow, tomorrow is today
You were born a lion and a lion you will stay

I am a lion and I want to be free
Do you see a lion when you look inside of me?
Outside the window just to watch you as you sleep
'Cause I am a lion born from things you cannot be

Remember an army of all those little kids?
Living life like they only get a little bit
It's hard to fight when you're born in the middle and
I'd rather die, won't watch you givin' in
I'm sorry daughter but your father's not the same
I can look into your eyes and I swear that I will change
But tomorrow is tomorrow so forgive me if I stay
You can hide beneath the covers while I hide behind the pain

After all, only so much we can say
Words can lose their meaning once you walk away
Promise that you'll love me, watch me as I fade
I'll give you all those things that these liars never gave
The hands on the clock and the things we cannot change
Tear it all to pieces and take back what I made
If there's one thing I'd keep, it's you that I would save
'Cause I am just a lion and a lion I will stay

I am a lion and I want to be free
Do you see a lion when you look inside of me?
Outside the window just to watch you as you sleep
'Cause I am a lion born from things you cannot be

Hey, I never meant to let go
All I want and you're all I ever wanna know
Can't hide in the attic of a pretty home
Of a pretty home, of a pretty home
Hey, I never meant to let go
All I want and you're all I ever wanna know
Can't hide in the attic of a pretty home
Of a pretty home, of a pretty home

Hey

I am a lion and I want to be free
Do you see a lion when you look inside of me?
Outside the window just to watch you as you sleep
'Cause I am a lion born from things you cannot be</pre></div>
