(Now now now now now)
(Now now now now now)
(Now now now now now)
(Now now now now now)

As I walk through the valley of the shadow of death
I wear my crown of thorns and pull the knife from my chest
I keep searching for something that I never seem to find
But maybe I won't because I left it all behind

Now I'm stuck with this and that'll never change
Always a part of me until the very last day
Where to go from here, what road to travel on
I spent my whole life choosing and it always chose wrong

Will I try to have the will to be alive
Will I try 'cause I've never seen the light
Blow it to the ground and it's now you see
You spent your whole life taking the best of me

Where'd you go
Where's your home
How'd you end up all alone
Can you hear me now

There's no light
There's no sound
Hard to breathe when you're underground
Can you hear me now
Hear me now

(Now now now now now)

How low can I keep pretending to be
That all the stars in the sky could mean something to me
Heaven will open up if I live on my knees
A man of many words but a man of few deeds

Walking these streets so absent of hope
A pillow of concrete, a man with no home
Lend him a hand then we'll walk him the way
Leave the virtue of pity but we live with the shame

So scared to dream in a world with no sunlight
When you wake up you know it's darker than last night
Quickly we forget, sacrifice gone by
Born to walk away, been walking my whole life

Where'd you go
Where's your home
How'd you end up all alone
Can you hear me now

There's no light
There's no sound
Hard to breathe when you're underground
Can you hear me now
Hear me now

Look into my eyes and I see
What do I see
Nothing at all (nothing at all)

Take another look around me
What do I see
Nothing at all

(Now now now now now)
(Now now now now now)

Where'd you go
Where's your home
How'd you end up all alone
Can you hear me now

There's no light
There's no sound
Hard to breathe when you're underground
Can you hear me now
Hear me now

(Now now now now now)
(Hear me now)
(Now now now now now)

Can you hear me
Hear me now
