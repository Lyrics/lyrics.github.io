<div><pre>My legs are dangling off the edge
The bottom of the bottle is my only friend
I think I'll slit my wrists again
And I'm gone, gone, gone, gone

My legs are dangling off the edge
A stomach full of pills didn't work again
I'll put a bullet in my head
And I'm gone, gone, gone, gone

Gone too far, yea I'm gone again
It's gone on too long, tell you how it ends
I'm sitting on the edge with my two best friends
One's a bottle of pills, and one's a bottle of gin

I'm twenty stories up, yea up at the top
I polished off this bottle, now it's pushing me off
Asphalt to me has never looked so soft
I bet my momma found my letter, now she's calling the cops

I've got to take this opportunity before I miss it
'Cause now I hear the sirens and they're off in the distance
Believe me when I tell you that I've been persistent
'Cause I'm more scarred, more scarred then my wrist is

I've been trying too long with too dull of a knife
But tonight I made sure that I sharpened it twice
I never bought a suit before in my life
But when you go to meet God, you know you want to look nice

So if I survive, then I'll see you tomorrow
Yea I'll see you tomorrow

My legs are dangling off the edge
The bottom of the bottle is my only friend
I think I'll slit my wrists again
And I'm gone, gone, gone, gone

My legs are dangling off the edge
A stomach full of pills didn't work again
I'll put a bullet in my head
And I'm gone, gone, gone, gone

We hit the sky, there goes the light
No more sun, why's it always night?
When you can't sleep, well you can't dream
When you can't dream well, what's life mean?

We feel a little pity but don't empathize
The old are getting older, watch a young man die
A mother and a son and someone you know
Smile at each other and realize you don't

You don't know what happened to that kid you raised
What happened to that father, who swore he'd stay
I didn't know, 'cause you didn't say
Now momma feels guilt, yea momma feels pain

When you were young, you never thought you'd die
Found out you could, but too scared to try
Looked in the mirror and you said goodbye
Climbed to the roof to see you if could fly

So if I survive, then I'll see you tomorrow
Yea, I'll see you tomorrow

My legs are dangling off the edge
The bottom of the bottle is my only friend
I think I'll slit my wrists again
And I'm gone, gone, gone, gone

My legs are dangling off the edge
A stomach full of pills didn't work again
I'll put a bullet in my head
And I'm gone, gone, gone, gone

I wish that I could fly
Way up in the sky
Like a bird so high
Oh, I might just try

I wish that I could fly
Way up in the sky
Like a bird so high
Oh, I might just try
Oh, I might just try</pre></div>
