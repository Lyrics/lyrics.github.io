So much terror I have seen,
Fought endless years for their revenge
Now I know this struggle ended nowhere
I am remembering with shame

I feel my time has come to fight for understanding
I'm not defeated, I'm not beaten
Thrown into the darkest dungeon,
I pay for my forgiving thoughts
They may preach about the same convictions,
But they will distort these high ideals

No ferocity will unsettle my beliefs
I am not taken by the enemy
Mechanisms of stagnation
As agitators rule the land

They want to make us live in fear
Yet all they get are unshed tears
They want to make us live in fear
Locked up in gloom for years
Try to silence my voice,
But I'm not beaten!

No brutality will unsettle my beliefs
I am not taken by their felony
Mechanisms of stagnation
As agitators rule the land

And a thousand miles away from home,
I meet my expelled brothers
Captured in a secret prison,
Isolation, regression, indignity for years

No atrocity will unsettle my beliefs
I am not taken by this agony
Mechanisms of stagnation
As agitators rule the land
