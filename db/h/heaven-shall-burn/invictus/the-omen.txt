The time has come for you
Why don't you see the omen
Open your eyes and cast their lies aside
Your craven kings are headed nowhere
Your blinded leaders, they're headed nowhere
You're headed nowhere

I know they tell you to believe their truth
But I will never stand this pain
I know they say not to worry anymore
But I just cannot look away
The truth is plain, this truth is plain

Closing your eyes is nothing but surrender
How can you ask me if we can save this world
For them it died so many years ago
Get on your knees and greet the omen

How often did they prove their ignorance to you
How many times did they betray
The truth is plain, this truth is plain
Selling the hard-won values we archived

You know that nothing will ever break the beast
You know there are millions left for dead
But no one broadcasts their cries
And now you dare to ask me, if we can save this world
For them it died so many years ago
Get on your knees and greet the omen

Closing your eyes is nothing but surrender,
A rotten act of treason
Please never ask me, if we can save this world
For them it died so many years ago
Get on your knees and greet the omen
