    <div class="view"><pre>I know that they will bleed in hell
But where is justice in this unjust world?
Where is the truth we died for?
You feed the lie they fight for

Silence and screams are the end of my song
There is no threat to scare us
Our tunes and words remain
As songs of rage to carry our names

Although your hangmen may be dead by now
There is no share of this blame
No cheap excuses we accept
Make no mistake about it

Our songs and words remain
As storms of rage to carry our names
We'll make you bleed for this
There is no share of this blame

Our wives and mothers,
So many years they hoped in vain
Nothing will be buried in oblivion
You saw no anguish in our eyes
This terror did not brake our will
Remember our names!

Silence and screams are the end of my song
There is no threat to scare us
Our songs and words remain
As storms of rage to carry our names

We'll make you bleed for this
You will share this blame
Nothing will be buried in oblivion
You saw no anguish in our eyes
Nothing will be buried in oblivion
You shall remember our names

We may be buried in forgotten grounds,
But the heartbeats of our loved ones
Will be the drums to break your sleep</pre></div>
