This is the war you called
And I'm the one who came to judge you.
Too soon your gods will leave,
This is the day of your defeat.
Welcome the newborn slaves,
Forgotten and betrayed.
Just burn it down.
Black skies will rise
And overshadow your demise.
Long for the peace of surrender.
Just stare into the void.
Welcome the newborn slaves,
Disfranchised and betrayed.
Just feed your new found hate,
A force nothing will break.
Just burn it,
Just burn it down.
It's in the air you breathe,
An everlasting poison,
An order of deceit,
It is a lie you bleed for.
It's in the words you speak,
Faint echoes of deception.
When will you ever see
No one will set you free.

Und damit du es verstehst,
Du folgst den falschen FÃ¼hrern.
Der Kampf ist nie vorbei,
Du bist nicht frei.
