Nothing but pain, nothing but anguish
Depriving me of mercy,refusing all compassion
These bare walls around me
My prison, my dungeon

Deliver me to ransom,
No god can justify this cruelty
There's nothing left for me
There's nothing left but agony

At last break down this dogma
Just let me go, just let me be
Just let it be my last breath
As all peace has left this world

There is serenity given in death
Silence is falling down
So long ago I lost my anchor
As all my sorrows drown

Given in death

The turmoil of this world is not my struggle anymore
The end is putting down its hand for me,
I see, I feel

As all my sorrows drown
Just let me go, just let me be
Just let it be my last breath
Days fade away, songs die away

My peace of mind, given in death
As all peace has left this world
So long ago I lost my anchor
I'm longing for redemption

Enclosed by the mists of oblivion,
Days fade away, songs die away
The turmoil of this world is not my struggle anymore
The end is putting down its hand for me,
I see, I feel
