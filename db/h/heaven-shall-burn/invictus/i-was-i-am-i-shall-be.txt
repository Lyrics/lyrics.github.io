Never forgive, never forget
This world is out of joint
Your order's built on sand
Conspiracy to murder, cold blooded murder
Assassinated the few who fought this wrongful system

And to you, you masters of affliction
We speak our words of truthfulness
Our death will hinder nothing
This is the way to walk, this is the time to act
I was, I am, I shall be

They heard the tunes of revolution
They felt we'd seize the power
Infamous deeds of desperation
You may take us off the streets,
But nothing stops this righteous rage

We know you sense the coming thunder
Insidious rulers
Never forgive, never forget
Of that there is no doubt
Never forgive, never forget
We know this storm will rage again
