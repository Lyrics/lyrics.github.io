for years we hide in blackness,
we have to sink into oblivion
this agony of fear absorbs my thinking
this anguish suffocates my souls
I saw countless acts of treason
once this heart was filled with force and comfort
but now there is nothing anymore

the home I knew has crumbled into dust
I know so many of these ruins

I watch it burn, my fatherland
to blood red skies I pray
impatiently I wait, I'm waiting for the end
as I hail the bombs of my saviours

as I'm craving for these sirens wailing
to leave this cell to cross the night
as they crawl into their bunkers
as they hide away and shake with fear

at least I dare to raise my eyes and whisper
I fill my lungs with life again
walking empty streets and orphaned quartiers
a shine like daylight in the light
