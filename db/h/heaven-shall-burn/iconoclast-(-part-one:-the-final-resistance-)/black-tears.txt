When I'm in this state of mind
I'm wishing I was blind
Sometimes life is more than pain to me

I feel the power of my grief
Death would be such a relief
All the secrets that I hide would die with me

Depression is my only friend
Will this torture never end?
Let me carry on to dreamer's sky

I keep crying in my dreams
Can you hear my endless screams?
When I fade away, I fade away...

This fluid on my cheek
It drains me, I get weak
My heart is cold and bleak
Black blood, black tears
Black tears, black tears

Life is like a masquerade
In debt to myself, but I can't pay
Soon I'll call it all a day, away

I never felt what you call guilt
I still believe "Do what thou wilt"
My sorrow will destroy the world I've built

This fluid on my cheek
It drains me, I get weak
My heart is cold and bleak
Black blood, black tears
Black tears, black tears
