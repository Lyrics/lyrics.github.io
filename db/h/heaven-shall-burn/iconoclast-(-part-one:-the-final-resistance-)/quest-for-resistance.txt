A nation reborn
Reborn into a new world
Awoken from dark eras
Ruins of an insane dream still cast their shadows
And demons from the past still walk among us
An age that bore no heroes

No answers to the few who raised their questions
Just like a poison, silence killed the truth

A quest for resistance
You're searching for an easy truth
But you betrayed them, they could not trust you

As you marched in lines and circles
As you held your flags up high
They had nowhere to run to
Your heroes, they could not dare to speak to you

But the courage you're reclaiming, it died a bitter death with them
No one here and no one there, no one heard them calling
