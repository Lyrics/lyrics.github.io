The world is in pieces, it's falling apart. Our lives are being shut down.
Years gone by. When will we try not living for ourselves, not living for man.

The world, the world I see in front of me is full of things that should not be, that should not be.

When will we change? When will we see who we are living for?
Are you living for yourself or something greater? It's in your hands, be the creator.

For the dead and the living we must all bear witness.
The lives we lead are filled with uncertainty, but no hope means no reality.
Get it, hope is a reality.
The lives we lead are filled with uncertainty. Open your eyes, see the dark, find the light.

I opened the black blinds, and when I look:
The world, the world I see in front of me is full of things that should not be.

When will we see, x2
See change?
Remember,
Hope is a reality. x3
Remember, hope is a reality.
