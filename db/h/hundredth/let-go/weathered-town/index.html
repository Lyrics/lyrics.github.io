<title>Hundredth – Weathered Town | Lyrics</title>
<meta name="description" content="Looking in the rear-view mirror at everything that I'm leaving behind. / I know this is right, I know it's my time. / Now is my time to escape this weathered town and what this place is all about. / I've gotta get out of here, but the memories I'll take with me. / Everywhere I go, to everyone I know. These memories will stay with me. / To escape this weathered town and what this place is all about. / These memories will stay with me, will stay, will stay with me. / And I don't know, I don't know if you'll ever understand. You can say that it's not worth it. / And you can say, you can say it's a wasted life. / But the memories, I'll take with me. These memories, they'll stay with me. / The memories, I'll take with me. These memories, they'll stay with me. / Holding onto the past each day leaves me empty, wanting everything to be the way it was. / There are better days to come, I just have to, I have to / let go. / let go. / let go. / Of the things that I have done and the ones who have moved on. / I've gotta get out of here, but the memories I'll take with me. / Everywhere I go, to everyone I know. These memories will stay with me. / I'll escape this weathered town and what this place is all about. / The memories, they'll stay with me, / They'll stay, / They'll stay, / They'll stay, / With me. / ____________________ / Name Weathered Town / Artist Hundredth / Album Let Go"/>
