<title>Hundredth â€“ Restless | Lyrics</title>
<meta name="description" content="I'm not okay. I can't find stability. / I'm not okay. I can't find stability. / Threading through my faith with a needle named doubt. / Putting it all together and then tearing it apart. / Throwing away the scraps and trying to restart. / Go back to the days when it was sunny and clean. / My soul stormed until it stopped trying to shine. / It settled for hazy messages from a black sky. / I still don't know why, know why. / No question I threw up, came back, and I don't know why. / Is this what I wanted to be? A restless soul wrestling with what I believe. / Or just a selfish soul blind to problems that tower over me, over me, that tower over me. / Slow fade out. Sun burn and stay out. Clouds close like a mouth. 'Round last light and sound. / Don't bother, save your breath. Could be the last you get. / Am I jaded to the point where I can't see all of the beauty Your hands made, the world surrounding me. / I'm scared of what has come and what is to be. My heavy heart. The Earth will cover me. / ______________ / Name Restless / Artist Hundredth / Album Let Go"/>
