    <div class="view"><pre>I can't put back together all these pieces, if everything around me stays the same.
Why do I compromise the convictions that I have.
I am the only one to blame, to blame. I am the one to blame.
My life still gets lost behind these eyes of complacency.
Torn to shreds by monotony, but not today.
I need a change.
I need a change.
Let my pride come crashing down.
My dreams they will remain, my purpose it must sustain.
My dreams they will remain, my purpose it must sustain.
Sustain.
I'm putting back together all these pieces and everything around me's not the same.
No longer do I compromise convictions that I have.
Everything now has changed, has changed. It's all changed.
No longer am I lost behind these eyes of complacency.
I have control of everything, everything.
It had to change.
It had to change.
My pride came crashing down.
I was only holding myself back, from being all that I can.
I was only holding myself back, from being all that I can.
I was only holding myself back, from being all that I can.
I was only holding myself back, from being all that I can.
All that I can.
I was holding myself back, holding myself back, from being all I can, all I can.</pre></div>
