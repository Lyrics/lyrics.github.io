(includes an original audio sample of C.S. Lewis giving a broadcasted sermon)

"Give up yourself and you will find your real self. Lose your life and you will save it." x2

"Even in literature or art no man who cares about originality will ever be original. It's the man who's only thinking about doing a good job or telling the truth who becomes really original, but doesn't notice it. Even in social life, you never make a good impression on other people until you stop thinking what sort of impression you make. That principle runs all through life from the top to the bottom. Give up yourself and you will find your real self. Lose your life and you will save it. Submit to death, submit with every fiber of your being and you will find eternal life." - C.S. Lewis

It's monumental for us to rise to the surface, just to breathe in some reality.
We've been drowning in uncertainty.

"Give up yourself and you will find your real self. Lose your life and you will save it."
