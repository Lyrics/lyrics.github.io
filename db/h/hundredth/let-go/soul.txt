If I had a fist for every time I've been trapped, I'd fight my way out and I'd never look back.
I'm lying down in the darkest places. I'm losing touch. I can't see faces.
I feel like I'm alone, am I alone?

I'm rising up reminding myself: dark is the absence of light.

To the day that I die. x2
My broken soul.

Cheatin' on the sun, x5
With the moon.
Cheatin' on the sun, x3
With the moon.
Soul. My broken soul.
