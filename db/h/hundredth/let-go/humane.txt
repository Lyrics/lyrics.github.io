We will bring fire to the empires. The imperial, they won't prevail.
We will raise. Raise that banner above it all. While they weep and wail.
And we turn our heads and look away.

Redemptive violence, take a seat right where you stand.
Humanity, we are destroying ourselves again, ourselves again.
Humanity, we are destroying ourselves. Humanity, we are destroying ourselves.
And I am no longer possessed by my possessions, that have costs behind my eyes.
Exploitation of innocence.

We spit in their faces, to keep ours looking prime.
We starve them of their freedom, freedom, to feed our lavish lives.
We put a price on their worth, to finance our greed.
And blindly pledge to a flag, when justice lies in a King.

We will bring fire to the empires. The imperial, they won't prevail.
We will raise. Raise that banner above it all. While they weep and wail.
We will not, we will not be deceived, deceived.

We will raise the banner of love above all flags. Over any nation that vies our allegiance. x2
