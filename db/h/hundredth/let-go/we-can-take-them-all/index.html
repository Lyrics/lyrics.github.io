It's all falling down, it's all crashing down.<br/>Everyone's telling me to focus on my dreams, but I can't lift my head from the suffering below.<br/>Sometimes I feel like there's no hope for mankind.<br/>Strapped down to tradition, chained to the lies we've been fed.<br/>Has this gone too far? Can we sever the hand of power hanging over our heads?</p><p>We can take them all. Let them line up against our generation that says no.<br/>We're not standing for this. We're bringing you to your knees. Turn your back on everything.<br/>To expose the lies and greed that you beg us to buy into.</p><p>I know they're all,<br/>I know they're all,<br/>I know they're all,<br/>I know they're all,<br/>Lies.</p><p>Question everything, 'cause nothing's what it seems.<br/>And they gave fake a face, force-fed the American dream.<br/>Shipped us overseas to be all we can be. We can't justify murder with freedom isn't free.</p><p>I challenge this generation to expand our minds and seek truth for ourselves.<br/>I challenge this generation to not buy into the dreams set forth by man.<br/>I challenge this generation to suffer without luxury and lend our greedy hands.<br/>I challenge this generation to not, to not forsake the unseen.</p></article></div>
