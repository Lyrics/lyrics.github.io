Looking in the rear-view mirror at everything that I'm leaving behind.
I know this is right, I know it's my time.
Now is my time to escape this weathered town and what this place is all about.

I've gotta get out of here, but the memories I'll take with me.
Everywhere I go, to everyone I know. These memories will stay with me.
To escape this weathered town and what this place is all about.
These memories will stay with me, will stay, will stay with me.

And I don't know, I don't know if you'll ever understand. You can say that it's not worth it.
And you can say, you can say it's a wasted life.
But the memories, I'll take with me. These memories, they'll stay with me.
The memories, I'll take with me. These memories, they'll stay with me.

Holding onto the past each day leaves me empty, wanting everything to be the way it was.
There are better days to come, I just have to, I have to
let go. x3
Of the things that I have done and the ones who have moved on.

I've gotta get out of here, but the memories I'll take with me.
Everywhere I go, to everyone I know. These memories will stay with me.
I'll escape this weathered town and what this place is all about.
The memories, they'll stay with me,
They'll stay, x3
With me.
