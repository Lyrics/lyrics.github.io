That's what it is today. It's time to make a change.<br/>I was never awake, just dreaming of the days when things were said and never done.<br/>But now this is the life I lead, only to breathe hope into humanity.<br/>But I made, I made a promise, I made, I made a promise to myself.<br/>I promised I'd never go back to thinking of this place as my wishing well.<br/>It's the same ol'<br/>take,<br/>take,<br/>take,<br/>I gave up on the world and that's all I could give.<br/>And I said I'll never go back to putting myself above the rest.<br/>I held my chin up high, but that's all I could lift.<br/>Inside of me,<br/>Inside of me,<br/>Was a void,<br/>Was a void,<br/>As empty,<br/>As empty,<br/>As the sky without the sun,<br/>Empty as the<br/>sky without the sun.<br/>sky without the sun.<br/>I was never awake, just dreaming of the days when things were said and never done.<br/>But now this is the life I lead, living only to breathe hope into humanity.
