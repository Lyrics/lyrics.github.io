Every breath I take recalls the wretch I once was,
The wretch I remain.
Fueled by hatred, by greed.
The inability to love a world that lets me down.

My misanthropy eats me alive. x3
My face in the dirt.
My head staring down. x2
Staring down.

A miserable existence,
A life fueled by hate.
Now my face to the world, steadfast.

My life once miserable is now immeasurable. x2

What can I do with a heart full of hate
Besides dig places to rest for those I love,
Besides make beds in the depths for those given up,
Besides dig places to rest for those I love.

My tattered soul needs mending
And I'm done searching.

No greater Love than this.
No greater Love.
No other Love.
