    <div class="view"><div id="lyrics">He walks the stairs and stands at the door.
Bottle in his right,
Fist in his left clenched tight.
He's already trampled over his wife.
The beginning of his family's demise
As he stares into his little girl's eyes,
His little girl's green eyes.
And to her surprise he actually came home tonight.
But he's still not acting right.

He knows better, but he's never experienced it.
It's a night much like when he was young.
Mama's on the floor again
Yelling "I love you"s at the man standing above her
Who can only respond with violence.
He notices the similarities, and begins to scream off the balcony:

"I will never be like you, I will always despise you.

Betrayer, where is your head?
Betrayer, where is your heart?
Betrayer, I will never be like you.
Betrayer, I will always despise you.

Betrayer, where is your head?
Betrayer, where is your heart?
Betrayer, I will never be like you.
Betrayer, I will always despise you."

He's still outside screaming into the wind
About his distaste for his former kin.
His evil thoughts are pushing him to the edge
And now he's flirting with that ledge.

Those green eyes look at him from behind,
She's begging him to change his mind.
He shows his back to those that he loves,
When he dives headfirst into the earth.

He buries his head, hiding it from the world.
Then screams his little girl.

"I will always despise you.

Betrayer, where is your head?
Betrayer, where is your heart?
Betrayer, I will never be like you.
Betrayer, I will always despise you.

I will always despise you.

I will always despise you."</div></div>
