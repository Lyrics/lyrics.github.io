    <div class="view"><div id="lyrics">What have I gained
By giving the world my everything?
It's never been such a struggle
To regress to what I was yesterday.
But today, I seem so far away.

I'm waiting on the world to sing
The song I've been singing.
I'm waiting on the world to sink
The way I've been sinking.
The way I've been sinking.

I've given too much away
Over these past few years
And this is ending today.

There's pain in my eyes like I've never known.
I have fallen short.
Do you still see me as beautiful?
Do you still see me as beautiful?

Carry me home,
Lighten my stagger.
My conscience is weak.
I'm begging for reparation.
I am deficient of hope, deficient of hope.

Refine me with fire.
Refine me with fire, oh God.
Refine me with fire.

There's pain in my eyes like I've never known.
I've fallen short.
Do you still see me as beautiful?

There's pain in my eyes like I've never known.
I've fallen short.
Do you still see me as beautiful?

I'll never find my place on Earth.
I'll never find, I'll never find my place
My place on Earth.
I'll never find my place on Earth.
But I refuse to fade away, to fade away.</div></div>
