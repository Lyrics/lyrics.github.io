Black eyes nose bleeds don't look back now
My white abode do you remember?
My white abode
But it's such a thrill just to find out...

Sorry you're not a winner
With the air so cold and a mind so bitter
What have you got to loose
But false intentions and a life so pretentious?

Scratch card glory or waist low pleasure?
Black eyes nose bleeds don't look back now
My white abode do you remember?
My white abode
But it's such a thrill just to find out...

Sorry you're not a winner
With the air so cold and a mind so bitter
What have you got to lose
But false intentions and a life so pretentious?

Scratch card glory or waist low pleasure?
Black eyes nose bleeds don't look back now
My white abode do you remember?
I sweat I ache...

Sorry you're not a winner
With the air so cold and a mind so bitter
What have you got to lose
But false intentions and a life so pretentious?

Zane Lowe BBC Session Version

Scratch card glory
Or waist low pleasure?
Black eyes nose bleeds
Don't look back now

My white abode
Do you remember?
My white abode
But it's such a thrill just to find out

Sorry you're not a winner
With the air so cold
And a mind so bitter

What have you got
To loose but false intentions
And a life so pretentious?

Scratch card glory
Or waist low pleasure?
Black eyes nose bleeds
Don't look back now

My white abode
Do you remember?
My white abode
But it's such a thrill just to find out

Sorry you're not a winner
With the air so cold
And a mind so bitter

What have you got
To loose but false intentions
And a life so pretentious?

Scratch card glory
Or waist low pleasure?
Black eyes nose bleeds
Don't look back now

My white abode
Do you remember?
I sweat,I ache

Sorry you're not a winner
With the air so cold
And a mind so bitter

What have you got
To loose but false intentions
And a life so pretentious?

What? What? What?
