All I do is drop F-bombs, feel my wrath of attack<span><br/></span>Rappers are having a rough time period, here's a maxi-pad<span><br/></span>It's actually disastrously bad for the wack<span><br/></span>While I'm masterfully constructing this masterpiece, yeah<span><br/></span><span class="g"><br/></span>'Cause I'm beginning to feel like a Rap God, Rap God<span><br/></span>All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod<span><br/></span>Now who thinks their arms are long enough to slapbox, slapbox?<span><br/></span>Let me show you maintaining this shit ain't that hard, that hard<span><br/></span><span class="g"><br/></span>Everybody want the key and the secret to rap immortality like I have got<span><br/></span>Well, to be truthful the blueprint's simply rage and youthful exuberance<span><br/></span>Everybody loves to root for a nuisance<span><br/></span>Hit the earth like an asteroid, I did nothing but shoot for the moon since<span><br/></span>*pew*<span><br/></span><span class="g"><br/></span>MCs get taken to school with this music<span><br/></span>'Cause I use it as a vehicle to bust the rhyme<span><br/></span>Now I lead a new school full of students<span><br/></span>Me? I'm a product of Rakim, Lakim Shabazz, 2Pac, N-<span><br/></span>-W.A, Cube, hey Doc, Ren, Yella, Eazy, thank you, they got Slim<span><br/></span><span class="g"><br/></span>Inspired enough to one day grow up, blow up, and be in a position<span><br/></span>To meet Run-D.M.C. and induct them into the motherfuckin' Rock n'<span><br/></span>Roll Hall of Fame<span><br/></span>Even though I'll walk in the church and burst in a ball of flames<span><br/></span>Only Hall of Fame I be inducted in is the alcohol of fame<span><br/></span>On the wall of shame<span><br/></span>You fags think it's all a game till I walk a flock of flames<span><br/></span>Off a plank and, tell me what in the fuck are you thinking?<span><br/></span>Little gay looking boy<span><br/></span><span class="g"><br/></span>So gay I can barely say it with a straight face looking boy<span><br/></span>You witnessing a massacre<span><br/></span>Like you watching a church gathering take place looking boy<span><br/></span>Oy vey, that boy's gay, that's all they say looking boy<span><br/></span>You get a thumbs up, pat on the back<span><br/></span>And a way to go from your label everyday looking boy<span><br/></span>Hey, looking boy, what you say looking boy?<span><br/></span>I get a "hell yeah" from Dre looking boy<span><br/></span>I'mma work for everything I have<span><br/></span>Never asked nobody for that shit, get outta my face looking boy<span><br/></span>Basically boy you're never gonna be capable<span><br/></span>Of keeping up with the same pace looking boy<span><br/></span><span class="g"><br/></span>'Cause I'm beginning to feel like a Rap God, Rap God<span><br/></span>All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod<span><br/></span>The way I'm racing around the track, call me Nascar, Nascar<span><br/></span>Dale Earnhardt of the trailer park, the White Trash God<span><br/></span>Kneel before General Zod this planet's Krypton, no Asgard, Asgard<span><br/></span><span class="g"><br/></span>So you be Thor and I'll be Odin, you rodent, I'm omnipotent<span><br/></span>Let off then I'm reloading immediately with these bombs I'm totin'<span><br/></span>And I should not be woken<span><br/></span>I'm the walking dead, but I'm just a talking head, a zombie floating<span><br/></span>But I got your mom deep throating<span><br/></span><span class="g"><br/></span>I'm out my Ramen noodle, we have nothing in common, poodle<span><br/></span>I'm a Doberman, pinch yourself in the arm and pay homage, pupil<span><br/></span>It's me, my honesty's brutal<span><br/></span>But it's honestly futile if I don't utilize what I do though<span><br/></span><span class="g"><br/></span>For good at least once in a while<span><br/></span>So I wanna make sure somewhere in this chicken scratch I scribble and doodle<span><br/></span>Enough rhymes to maybe try to help get some people through tough times<span><br/></span>But I gotta keep a few punchlines just in case 'cause even you unsigned<span><br/></span>Rappers are hungry looking at me like it's lunchtime<span><br/></span>I know there was a time where once I<span><br/></span>Was king of the underground, but I still rap like I'm on my Pharoahe Monch grind<span><br/></span><span class="g"><br/></span>So I crunch rhymes, but sometimes when you combine<span><br/></span>Appeal with the skin color of mine<span><br/></span>You get too big and here they come trying to censor you<span><br/></span>Like that one line I said on "I'm Back" from The Mathers LP<span><br/></span>One where I tried to say I'd take seven kids from Columbine<span><br/></span>Put 'em all in a line, add an AK-47, a revolver and a nine<span><br/></span>See if I get away with it now that I ain't as big as I was, but I'm<span><br/></span><span class="g"><br/></span>Morphin' into an immortal coming through the portal<span><br/></span>You're stuck in a time warp from 2004 though<span><br/></span>And I don't know what the fuck that you rhyme for<span><br/></span>You're pointless as Rapunzel with fucking cornrows<span><br/></span>You write normal, fuck being normal<span><br/></span>And I just bought a new raygun from the future<span><br/></span><span class="g"><br/></span>To just come and shoot ya like when Fabolous made Ray J mad<span><br/></span>'Cause Fab said he looked like a fag at Maywhether's pad<span><br/></span>Singin' to a man while he played piano<span><br/></span>Man, oh, man, that was the 24/7 special on the cable channel<span><br/></span>So Ray J went straight to the radio station the very next day<span><br/></span>"Hey, Fab, I'mma kill you"<span><br/></span>Lyrics coming at you at supersonic speed, JJ Fad<span><br/></span><span class="g"><br/></span>Uh, sama lamaa duma lamaa you assuming I'm a human<span><br/></span>What I gotta do to get it through to you I'm superhuman<span><br/></span>Innovative and I'm made of rubber<span><br/></span>So that anything you say is ricocheting off of me and it'll glue to you<span><br/></span>I'm devastating, more than never demonstrating<span><br/></span>How to give a motherfuckin' audience a feeling like it's levitating<span><br/></span>Never fading, and I know the haters are forever waiting<span><br/></span>For the day that they can say I fell off, they'll be celebrating<span><br/></span>'Cause I know the way to get 'em motivated<span><br/></span>I make elevating music, you make elevator music<span><br/></span>Oh, he's too mainstream<span><br/></span>Well, that's what they do when they get jealous, they confuse it<span><br/></span>It's not hip-hop, it's pop, 'cause I found a hella way to fuse it<span><br/></span>With rock, shock rap with Doc<span><br/></span>Throw on Lose Yourself and make 'em lose it<span><br/></span><span class="g"><br/></span>I don't know how to make songs like that<span><br/></span>I don't know what words to use<span><br/></span>Let me know when it occurs to you<span><br/></span>While I'm ripping any one of these verses diverse as you<span><br/></span>It's curtains, I'm inadvertently hurtin' you<span><br/></span>How many verses I gotta murder to prove<span><br/></span>That if you were half as nice, your songs and you could sacrifice virgins too<span><br/></span><span class="g"><br/></span>School flunky, pill junky<span><br/></span>But look at the accolades these skills brung me<span><br/></span>Full of myself, but still hungry<span><br/></span>I bully myself 'cause I make me do what I put my mind to<span><br/></span>And I'm a million leagues above you, ill when I speak in tongues<span><br/></span>But it's still tongue and cheek, fuck you<span><br/></span>I'm drunk so Satan take the fucking wheel, I'm asleep in the front seat<span><br/></span>Bumping Heavy D. & the Boys, still chunky, but funky<span><br/></span>But in my head there's something I can feel tugging and struggling<span><br/></span>Angels fight with devils and here's what they want from me<span><br/></span><span class="g"><br/></span>They asking me to eliminate some of the women hate<span><br/></span>But if you take into consideration the bitter hatred that I had<span><br/></span>Then you may be a little patient and more sympathetic to the situation<span><br/></span>And understand the discrimination<span><br/></span><span class="g"><br/></span>But fuck it, life's handing you lemons, make lemonade then<span><br/></span>But if I can't batter the women how the fuck am I supposed to bake them a cake then?<span><br/></span>Don't mistake it for Satan<span><br/></span>It's a fatal mistake if you think I need to be overseas<span><br/></span>And take a vacation to trip a broad<span><br/></span>And make her fall on her face and don't be a retard<span><br/></span>Be a king? Think not<span><br/></span>Why be a king when you can be a God?<span><br/></span><br/><br/><br/><hr/><p>Name  Rap God<br/>Artist  Eminem<br/>Album  The Marshall Mathers LP 2</p></blockquote></div>
