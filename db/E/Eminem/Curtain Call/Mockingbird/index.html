<br/><span></span>But hey, what daddy always tell you?
<br/><span></span>Straighten up little soldier, stiffen up that upper lip
<br/><span></span>What you crying about?
<br/><span></span>You got me<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>Hailie, I know you miss your mom, and I know you miss your dad
<br/><span></span>When I’m gone, but I’m trying to give you the life that I never had
<br/><span></span>I can see you’re sad, even when you smile, even when you laugh
<br/><span></span>I can see it in your eyes, deep inside, you want to cry<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>’Cause you’re scared; I ain’t there? Daddy’s with you in your prayers
<br/><span></span>No more crying, wipe them tears; daddy’s here, no more nightmares
<br/><span></span>We gon’ pull together through it, we gon’ do it
<br/><span></span>Laney uncle’s crazy, ain’t he? Yeah, but he loves you girl and you better know it<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>We’re all we got in this world When it spins, when it swirls
<br/><span></span>When it whirls, when it twirls two little beautiful girls
<br/><span></span>Lookin’ puzzled, in a daze. I know it’s confusin’ you
<br/><span></span>Daddy’s always on the move; mama’s always on the news<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>I try to keep you sheltered from it, but somehow it seems
<br/><span></span>The harder that I try to do that, the more it backfires on me
<br/><span></span>All the things growing up his daddy that he had to see
<br/><span></span>Daddy don’t want you to see, but you see just as much as he did<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>We did not plan it to be this way, your mother and me
<br/><span></span>But things have gotten so bad between us, I don’t see us ever being together
<br/><span></span>Ever again, like we used to be when we was teenagers
<br/><span></span>But then of course everything always happens for a reason<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>I guess it was never meant to be
<br/><span></span>But it’s just something we have no control over, and that’s what destiny is
<br/><span></span>But no more worries, rest your head, and go to sleep
<br/><span></span>Maybe one day we’ll wake up, and this will all just be a dream<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>Now hush little baby, don’t you cry
<br/><span></span>Everything’s gonna be all right
<br/><span></span>Stiffen that upper lip up little lady, I told ya
<br/><span></span>Daddy’s here to hold ya through the night<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>I know mommy’s not here right now, and we don’t know why
<br/><span></span>We fear how we feel inside
<br/><span></span>It may seem a little crazy, pretty baby
<br/><span></span>But I promise mama’s gon’ be all right<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>It’s funny, I remember back one year, when daddy had no money
<br/><span></span>Mommy wrapped the Christmas presents up and stuck ’em under the tree
<br/><span></span>And said some of ’em were from me, ’cause daddy couldn’t buy ’em
<br/><span></span>I’ll never forget that Christmas; I sat up the whole night crying<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>’Cause daddy felt like a bum, see daddy had a job
<br/><span></span>But his job was to keep the food on the table for you and mom
<br/><span></span>And at the time, every house that we lived in either kept getting broke into and robbed or shot up on the block<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>And your mom was saving money for you in a jar
<br/><span></span>Tryma start a piggy bank for you so you could go to college
<br/><span></span>Almost had a thousand dollars, till someone broke in and stole it
<br/><span></span>And I know it hurt so bad, it broke your mama’s heart
<br/><span></span>And it seemed like everything was just startin’ to fall apart<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>Mom and dad was arguin’ a lot, so mama moved back
<br/><span></span>On the Chalmers in the flat—one bedroom apartment
<br/><span></span>And dad moved back to the other side of 8 Mile on Novara
<br/><span></span>And that’s when daddy went to California with his CD
<br/><span></span>And met Dr. Dre and flew you and mama out to see me<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>But daddy had to work, you and momma had to leave me
<br/><span></span>Then you started seeing daddy on the TV
<br/><span></span>And mama didn’t like it and you and Laney were to young to understand it
<br/><span></span>Papa was a Rollin’ Stone, momma developed a habit
<br/><span></span>And it all happened too fast for either one of us to grab it
<br/><span></span>I’m just sorry you were there and had to witness it first hand<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>’Cause all I ever wanted to do was just make you proud
<br/><span></span>Now I’m sittin’ in this empty house
<br/><span></span>Just reminiscing lookin’ at your baby pictures, it just trips me out
<br/><span></span>To see how much you both have grown, it’s almost like you’re sisters now<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>Wow, guess you pretty much are and, daddy’s still here
<br/><span></span>Laney I’m talkin’ to you too: Daddy’s still here
<br/><span></span>I like the sound of that, yeah; it’s got a ring to it, don’t it?
<br/><span></span>Shh, mama’s only gone for the moment<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>Now hush little baby, don’t you cry
<br/><span></span>Everything’s gonna be all right
<br/><span></span>Stiffen that upper lip up little lady, I told ya
<br/><span></span>Daddy’s here to hold ya through the night<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>I know mommy’s not here right now, and we don’t know why
<br/><span></span>We fear how we feel inside
<br/><span></span>It may seem a little crazy, pretty baby
<br/><span></span>But I promise mama’s gon’ be all right<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>And if you ask me, too, daddy’s gonna buy you a mockingbird
<br/><span></span>I’mma give you the world
<br/><span></span>I’mma buy a diamond ring for you, I’mma sing for you
<br/><span></span>I’ll do anything for you to see you smile<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>And if that mockingbird don’t sing and that ring don’t shine
<br/><span></span>I’mma break that birdie’s neck
<br/><span></span>I’d go back to the jeweler who sold it to ya
<br/><span></span>And make him eat every karat; don’t fuck with dad (haha)<br/><span></span><br/><span></span><br/></div><hr/><table><tbody><tr><td>Song name&nbsp;</td><td>Mockingbird</td><tr><td>Artist&nbsp;</td><td>Eminem</td><tr><td>Album&nbsp;</td><td>Curtain Call</td></tbody></table><div id="lyrics-actions"><a href="https://github.com/Lyrics/lyrics/edit/master/database/E/Eminem/Curtain Call/Mockingbird">Suggest improvements for this text</a></div></div></div></div><script>var i=document.createElement("input");i.name="q";i.type="search";i.placeholder="Search";document.forms[0].firstChild.appendChild(i)</script>
