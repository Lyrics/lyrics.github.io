<br/><span></span>We all fall down…<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>Step by step, heart to heart, left right left
<br/><span></span>We all fall down like toy soldiers
<br/><span></span>Bit by bit, torn apart, we never win
<br/><span></span>But the battle wages on for toy soldiers<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>I’m supposed to be the soldier who never blows his composure
<br/><span></span>Even though I hold the weight of the whole world on my shoulders
<br/><span></span>I ain’t never supposed to show it, my crew ain’t supposed to know it
<br/><span></span>Even if it means goin’ toe to toe with a Benzino it don’t matter<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>I’d never drag them in battles that I can handle unless I absolutely have to
<br/><span></span>I’m supposed to set an example
<br/><span></span>I need to be the leader, my crew looks for me to guide ’em
<br/><span></span>If some shit ever just pop off, I’m supposed to be beside ’em<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>Now the Ja shit I tried to squash it, it was too late to stop it
<br/><span></span>There’s a certain line you just don’t cross and he crossed it
<br/><span></span>I heard him say Hailie’s name on a song and I just lost it
<br/><span></span>It was crazy, this shit be way beyond some Jay-Z and Nas shit<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>And even though the battle was won, I feel like we lost it
<br/><span></span>I spent too much energy on it, honestly I’m exhausted
<br/><span></span>And I’m so caught in it I almost feel I’m the one who caused it
<br/><span></span>This ain’t what I’m in hip-hop for, it’s not why I got in it<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>That was never my object for someone to get killed
<br/><span></span>Why would I wanna destroy something I helped build?
<br/><span></span>It wasn’t my intentions, my intentions was good
<br/><span></span>I went through my whole career without ever mentionin’ it<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>Now it’s just out of respect for not runnin’ my mouth
<br/><span></span>And talkin’ about something that I knew nothing about
<br/><span></span>Plus Dre told me stay out, this just wasn’t my beef
<br/><span></span>So I did, I just fell back, watched and gritted my teeth<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>While he’s all over TV down talkin’ a man
<br/><span></span>Who literally saved my life, like "Fuck it, I understand"
<br/><span></span>This is business and this shit just isn’t none of my business
<br/><span></span>But still knowin’ this shit could pop off at any minute ’cause<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>Step by step, heart to heart, left right left
<br/><span></span>We all fall down like toy soldiers
<br/><span></span>Bit by bit, torn apart, we never win
<br/><span></span>But the battle wages on for toy soldiers<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>There used to be a time when you could just say a rhyme
<br/><span></span>And wouldn’t have to worry about one of your people dyin’
<br/><span></span>But now it’s elevated ’cause once you put someone’s kids in it
<br/><span></span>The shit gets escalated, it ain’t just words no more is it?<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>It’s a different ball game, callin’ names and you ain’t just rappin’
<br/><span></span>We actually tried to stop the 50 and Ja beef from happenin’
<br/><span></span>Me and Dre had sat with him, kicked it and had a chat with him
<br/><span></span>And asked him not to start it he wasn’t gonna go after him<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>Until Ja started yappin’ in magazines how we stabbed him
<br/><span></span>Fuck it 50 smash ’em, mash ’em, and let him have it
<br/><span></span>Meanwhile my attention is pulled in another direction
<br/><span></span>Some receptionist at The Source who answers phones at his desk<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>Has an erection for me and thinks that I’ll be his resurrection
<br/><span></span>Tries to blow the dust off his mic and make a new record
<br/><span></span>But now he’s fucked the game up ’cause one of the ways I came up
<br/><span></span>Was through that publication, the same one that made me famous<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>Now the owner of it has got a grudge against me for nothin’
<br/><span></span>Well fuck it, that mutherfucker can get it too, fuck him then
<br/><span></span>When I’m so busy being pissed off I don’t stop to think
<br/><span></span>That we just inherited 50’s beef with Murder Inc.<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>And he’s inherited mine which is fine ain’t like either of us mind
<br/><span></span>We still have soldiers that’s on the front line
<br/><span></span>That’s willing to die for us as soon as we give the orders
<br/><span></span>Never to extort us, strictly to show they support us<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>We’ll maybe shout ’em out in a rap or up in a chorus
<br/><span></span>To show them we love ’em back and let ’em know how important it is
<br/><span></span>To have Runyon Avenue soldiers up in our corners
<br/><span></span>Their loyalty to us is worth more than any award is<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>But I ain’t tryna have none of my people hurt or murdered
<br/><span></span>It ain’t worth it, I can’t think of a perfecter way to word it
<br/><span></span>Than to just say that I love ya’ll too much to see the verdict
<br/><span></span>I’ll walk away from it all before I let it go any further<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>But don’t get it twisted, it’s not a plea that I’m coppin’
<br/><span></span>I’m just willin’ to be the bigger man if y’all can quit poppin’
<br/><span></span>Off at your jaws with the knockin’ ’cause frankly I’m sick of talkin’
<br/><span></span>I’m not gonna let someone else’s coffin rest on my conscience ’cause<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>Step by step, heart to heart, left right left
<br/><span></span>We all fall down like toy soldiers
<br/><span></span>Bit by bit, torn apart, we never win
<br/><span></span>But the battle wages on for toy soldiers<br/><span></span><br/><span></span><br/></div><hr/><table><tbody><tr><td>Song name&nbsp;</td><td>Like Toy Soldiers</td><tr><td>Artist&nbsp;</td><td>Eminem</td><tr><td>Album&nbsp;</td><td>Curtain Call</td></tbody></table><div id="lyrics-actions"><a href="https://github.com/Lyrics/lyrics/edit/master/database/E/Eminem/Curtain Call/Like Toy Soldiers">Suggest improvements for this text</a></div></div></div></div><script>var i=document.createElement("input");i.name="q";i.type="search";i.placeholder="Search";document.forms[0].firstChild.appendChild(i)</script>
