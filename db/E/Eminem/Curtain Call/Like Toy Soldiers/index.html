left right left<span><br/></span>We all fall down like toy soldiers<span><br/></span>Bit by bit, torn apart, we never win<span><br/></span>But the battle wages on for toy soldiers<span><br/></span><span class="g"><br/></span>I'm supposed to be the soldier who never blows his composure<span><br/></span>Even though I hold the weight of the whole world on my shoulders<span><br/></span>I ain't never supposed to show it, my crew ain't supposed to know it<span><br/></span>Even if it means goin' toe to toe with a Benzino it don't matter<span><br/></span><span class="g"><br/></span>I'd never drag them in battles that I can handle unless I absolutely have to<span><br/></span>I'm supposed to set an example<span><br/></span>I need to be the leader, my crew looks for me to guide 'em<span><br/></span>If some shit ever just pop off, I'm supposed to be beside 'em<span><br/></span><span class="g"><br/></span>Now the Ja shit I tried to squash it, it was too late to stop it<span><br/></span>There's a certain line you just don't cross and he crossed it<span><br/></span>I heard him say Hailie's name on a song and I just lost it<span><br/></span>It was crazy, this shit be way beyond some Jay-Z and Nas shit<span><br/></span><span class="g"><br/></span>And even though the battle was won, I feel like we lost it<span><br/></span>I spent too much energy on it, honestly I'm exhausted<span><br/></span>And I'm so caught in it I almost feel I'm the one who caused it<span><br/></span>This ain't what I'm in hip-hop for, it's not why I got in it<span><br/></span><span class="g"><br/></span>That was never my object for someone to get killed<span><br/></span>Why would I wanna destroy something I helped build?<span><br/></span>It wasn't my intentions, my intentions was good<span><br/></span>I went through my whole career without ever mentionin' it<span><br/></span><span class="g"><br/></span>Now it's just out of respect for not runnin' my mouth<span><br/></span>And talkin' about something that I knew nothing about<span><br/></span>Plus Dre told me stay out, this just wasn't my beef<span><br/></span>So I did, I just fell back, watched and gritted my teeth<span><br/></span><span class="g"><br/></span>While he's all over TV down talkin' a man<span><br/></span>Who literally saved my life, like "Fuck it, I understand"<span><br/></span>This is business and this shit just isn't none of my business<span><br/></span>But still knowin' this shit could pop off at any minute 'cause<span><br/></span><span class="g"><br/></span>Step by step, heart to heart, left right left<span><br/></span>We all fall down like toy soldiers<span><br/></span>Bit by bit, torn apart, we never win<span><br/></span>But the battle wages on for toy soldiers<span><br/></span><span class="g"><br/></span>There used to be a time when you could just say a rhyme<span><br/></span>And wouldn't have to worry about one of your people dyin'<span><br/></span>But now it's elevated 'cause once you put someone's kids in it<span><br/></span>The shit gets escalated, it ain't just words no more is it?<span><br/></span><span class="g"><br/></span>It's a different ball game, callin' names and you ain't just rappin'<span><br/></span>We actually tried to stop the 50 and Ja beef from happenin'<span><br/></span>Me and Dre had sat with him, kicked it and had a chat with him<span><br/></span>And asked him not to start it he wasn't gonna go after him<span><br/></span><span class="g"><br/></span>Until Ja started yappin' in magazines how we stabbed him<span><br/></span>Fuck it 50 smash 'em, mash 'em, and let him have it<span><br/></span>Meanwhile my attention is pulled in another direction<span><br/></span>Some receptionist at The Source who answers phones at his desk<span><br/></span><span class="g"><br/></span>Has an erection for me and thinks that I'll be his resurrection<span><br/></span>Tries to blow the dust off his mic and make a new record<span><br/></span>But now he's fucked the game up 'cause one of the ways I came up<span><br/></span>Was through that publication, the same one that made me famous<span><br/></span><span class="g"><br/></span>Now the owner of it has got a grudge against me for nothin'<span><br/></span>Well fuck it, that mutherfucker can get it too, fuck him then<span><br/></span>When I'm so busy being pissed off I don't stop to think<span><br/></span>That we just inherited 50's beef with Murder Inc.<span><br/></span><span class="g"><br/></span>And he's inherited mine which is fine ain't like either of us mind<span><br/></span>We still have soldiers that's on the front line<span><br/></span>That's willing to die for us as soon as we give the orders<span><br/></span>Never to extort us, strictly to show they support us<span><br/></span><span class="g"><br/></span>We'll maybe shout 'em out in a rap or up in a chorus<span><br/></span>To show them we love 'em back and let 'em know how important it is<span><br/></span>To have Runyon Avenue soldiers up in our corners<span><br/></span>Their loyalty to us is worth more than any award is<span><br/></span><span class="g"><br/></span>But I ain't tryna have none of my people hurt or murdered<span><br/></span>It ain't worth it, I can't think of a perfecter way to word it<span><br/></span>Than to just say that I love ya'll too much to see the verdict<span><br/></span>I'll walk away from it all before I let it go any further<span><br/></span><span class="g"><br/></span>But don't get it twisted, it's not a plea that I'm coppin'<span><br/></span>I'm just willin' to be the bigger man if y'all can quit poppin'<span><br/></span>Off at your jaws with the knockin' 'cause frankly I'm sick of talkin'<span><br/></span>I'm not gonna let someone else's coffin rest on my conscience 'cause<span><br/></span><span class="g"><br/></span>Step by step, heart to heart, left right left<span><br/></span>We all fall down like toy soldiers<span><br/></span>Bit by bit, torn apart, we never win<span><br/></span>But the battle wages on for toy
