<br/><span></span>Got out of bed at all
<br/><span></span>The morning rain clouds up my window
<br/><span></span>And I can't see at all
<br/><span></span>And even if I could it'll all be gray, but your picture on my wall
<br/><span></span>It reminds me that it's not so bad, it's not so bad<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>My tea's gone cold I'm wondering why I
<br/><span></span>Got out of bed at all
<br/><span></span>The morning rain clouds up my window
<br/><span></span>And I can't see at all
<br/><span></span>And even if I could it'll all be gray, but your picture on my wall
<br/><span></span>It reminds me that it's not so bad, it's not so bad<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>Dear Slim, I wrote but you still ain't callin'
<br/><span></span>I left my cell, my pager and my home phone at the bottom
<br/><span></span>I sent two letters back in autumn, you must not'a got 'em
<br/><span></span>There probably was a problem at the post office or somethin'<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>Sometimes I scribble addresses too sloppy when I jot 'em
<br/><span></span>But anyways; fuck it, what's been up? Man, how's your daughter?
<br/><span></span>My girlfriend's pregnant too, I'm 'bout to be a father
<br/><span></span>If I have a daughter, guess what I'mma call her? I'mma name her Bonnie<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>I read about your Uncle Ronnie, too, I'm sorry.
<br/><span></span>I had a friend kill himself over some bitch who didn't want him
<br/><span></span>I know you probably hear this everyday, but I'm your biggest fan
<br/><span></span>I even got the underground shit that you did with Skam<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>I got a room full of your posters and your pictures man
<br/><span></span>I like the shit you did with Rawkus too; that shit was phat!
<br/><span></span>Anyways, I hope you get this man, hit me back, just to chat
<br/><span></span>Truly yours, your biggest fan, this is Stan<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>My tea's gone cold I'm wondering why I
<br/><span></span>Got out of bed at all
<br/><span></span>The morning rain clouds up my window
<br/><span></span>And I can't see at all
<br/><span></span>And even if I could it'll all be gray, but your picture on my wall
<br/><span></span>It reminds me that it's not so bad, it's not so bad<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>Dear Slim, you still ain't called or wrote, I hope you have a chance
<br/><span></span>I ain't mad, I just think it's fucked up you don't answer fans
<br/><span></span>If you didn't wanna talk to me outside your concert
<br/><span></span>You didn't have to, but you coulda signed an autograph for Matthew<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>That's my little brother man, he's only six years old
<br/><span></span>We waited in the blistering cold for you, four hours and you just said, "No"
<br/><span></span>That's pretty shitty man, you're like his fuckin' idol
<br/><span></span>He wants to be just like you man, he likes you more than I do<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>I ain't that mad though, I just don't like bein' lied to
<br/><span></span>Remember when we met in Denver, you said if I'd write you
<br/><span></span>You would write back, see I'm just like you in a way
<br/><span></span>I never knew my father neither
<br/><span></span>He used to always cheat on my mom and beat her<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>I can relate to what you're saying in your songs
<br/><span></span>So when I have a shitty day, I drift away and put 'em on
<br/><span></span>'Cause I don't really got shit else so that shit helps when I'm depressed
<br/><span></span>I even got a tattoo of your name across the chest<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>Sometimes I even cut myself to see how much it bleeds
<br/><span></span>It's like adrenaline, the pain is such a sudden rush for me
<br/><span></span>See everything you say is real, and I respect you cause you tell it
<br/><span></span>My girlfriend's jealous 'cause I talk about you twenty-four/seven<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>But she don't know you like I know you Slim, no-one does
<br/><span></span>She don't know what it was like for people like us growin' up
<br/><span></span>You gotta call me man, I'll be the biggest fan you'll ever lose
<br/><span></span>Sincerely yours, Stan
<br/><span></span>P.S. We should be together, too<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>My tea's gone cold I'm wondering why I
<br/><span></span>Got out of bed at all
<br/><span></span>The morning rain clouds up my window
<br/><span></span>And I can't see at all
<br/><span></span>And even if I could it'll all be gray, but your picture on my wall
<br/><span></span>It reminds me that it's not so bad, it's not so bad<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>Dear Mr. I'm-Too-Good-To-Call-Or-Write-My-Fans:
<br/><span></span>This'll be the last package I ever send your ass!
<br/><span></span>It's been six months and still no word, I don't deserve it?
<br/><span></span>I know you got my last two letters; I wrote the addresses on 'em perfect<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>So this is my cassette I'm sending you, I hope you hear it
<br/><span></span>I'm in the car right now, I'm doing 90 on the freeway
<br/><span></span>Hey Slim, I drank a fifth of vodka, you dare me to drive?
<br/><span></span>You know the song by Phil Collins, In the Air of the Night?<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>About that guy who coulda saved that other guy from drowning?
<br/><span></span>But didn't, then Phil saw it all, then at a show he found him?
<br/><span></span>That's kinda how this is, you coulda rescued me from drowning
<br/><span></span>Now it's too late, I'm on a thousand downers now, I'm drowsy<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>And all I wanted was a lousy letter or a call
<br/><span></span>I hope you know I ripped all of your pictures off the wall
<br/><span></span>I love you Slim, we coulda been together, think about it
<br/><span></span>You ruined it now, I hope you can't sleep and you dream about it<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>And when you dream, I hope you can't sleep and you scream about it
<br/><span></span>I hope your conscience eats at you and you can't breathe without me
<br/><span></span>See Slim; shut up bitch! I'm tryin' to talk!
<br/><span></span>Hey Slim, that's my girlfriend screamin' in the trunk<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>But I didn't slit her throat, I just tied her up, see I ain't like you
<br/><span></span>'Cause if she suffocates, she'll suffer more and then she'll die too
<br/><span></span>Well, gotta go, I'm almost at the bridge now - Oh, shit! I forgot!
<br/><span></span>How am I supposed to send this shit out?<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>My tea's gone cold I'm wondering why I
<br/><span></span>Got out of bed at all
<br/><span></span>The morning rain clouds up my window
<br/><span></span>And I can't see at all
<br/><span></span>And even if I could it'll all be gray, but your picture on my wall
<br/><span></span>It reminds me that it's not so bad, it's not so bad<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>Dear Stan, I meant to write you sooner but I just been busy
<br/><span></span>You said your girlfriend's pregnant now, how far along is she?
<br/><span></span>Look, I'm really flattered you would call your daughter that
<br/><span></span>And here's an autograph for your brother, I wrote it on the Starter cap<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>I'm sorry I didn't see you at the show, I musta missed you
<br/><span></span>Don't think I did that shit intentionally just to diss you
<br/><span></span>But what's this shit you said about you like to cut your wrists too?
<br/><span></span>I say that shit just clownin' dogg; c'mon, how fucked up is you?<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>You got some issues Stan, I think you need some counselling
<br/><span></span>To help your ass from bouncing off the walls when you get down some
<br/><span></span>And what's this shit about us meant to be together?
<br/><span></span>That type of shit'll make me not want us to meet each other!<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>I really think you and your girlfriend need each other
<br/><span></span>Or maybe you just need to treat her better
<br/><span></span>I hope you get to read this letter, I just hope it reaches you in time
<br/><span></span>Before you hurt yourself, I think that you'll be doin' just fine<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>If you relax a little, I'm glad I inspire you, but Stan
<br/><span></span>Why are you so mad? Try to understand, that I do want you as a fan
<br/><span></span>I just don't want you to do some crazy shit
<br/><span></span>I seen this one shit on the news a couple weeks ago that made me sick<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>Some dude was drunk and drove his car over a bridge
<br/><span></span>And had his girlfriend in the trunk and she was pregnant with his kid
<br/><span></span>And in the car they found a tape, but they didn't say who it was to
<br/><span></span>Come to think of it, his name was... it was you!
