    <div class="view"><pre>So now you're running
It's hard to see clearly
When I make you angry
You're stuck in the past

And now you're screaming
So can you forgive me?
I've treated you badly
But I am still here

Sometimes I wonder
Why I'm still waiting
Sometimes I'm shaking
That's how you make me
Sometimes I question
Why I am still here
Sometimes I think I am going crazy

Can you help me understand?
And now you wish that you meant something
And now you wish that you meant something to somebody else
And now you wish that you met someone
And now you wish that you meant something to somebody else
(someone) (something to somebody else)

You look at me through clouded eyes
I know you see through my lies
See the sky, see the stars
All of this could be ours
Out of sight, out of mind
We've been through this a thousand times
Turn your back and then you make me feel so crazy

Can you help me understand?
And now you wish that you meant something
And now you wish that you meant something to somebody else
And now you wish that you met someone
And now you wish that you meant something to somebody else

You know I would wait forever
Yes, I would wait (I would wait)

You know I would wait forever
Yes, I would wait

And now you wish that you meant something
And now you wish that you meant something to somebody else
And now you wish that you met someone
And now you wish that you meant something to somebody else

And I'm the one that should mean something
But still you wish that you meant something to somebody else
Something to somebody else, something to somebody else</pre></div>
