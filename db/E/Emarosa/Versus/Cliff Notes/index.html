    <div class="view"><pre>This isn't war
This isn't courage
This isn't how you're supposed to be
And all the things keeping you awake
Are leaving me afraid
This isn't war
This isn't courage
And I don't believe that you're okay
The reason why I forget to close my eyes
When you're next to me
I feel you're going to leave

When birthdays are suicide days
And waking up it's hard to stay
I want to see you when you come down
So save yourself for me
I want to see you when you come down
So save yourself

The weight of loves forever trying
And it's enough to bury me
All the things keeping you awake
Are leaving finally

When birthdays are suicide days
And waking up it's hard to stay
I want to see you when you come down
So save yourself for me
I want to see you when you come down
So save yourself

Always said the same way I'm okay
Always walk away in chains
You know we wish you'd come around
Because nothing's changed
But it doesn't feel the same

I want to see you when you come down
So save yourself for me
I want to see you when you come down
So save yourself</pre></div>
