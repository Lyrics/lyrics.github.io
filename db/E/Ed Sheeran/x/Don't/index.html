<br/><span></span>She said "Don't you worry if I disappear"
<br/><span></span>I told her "I'm not really looking for another mistake"
<br/><span></span>I called an old friend thinking that the trouble would wait
<br/><span></span>But then I jumped right in a week later, returned
<br/><span></span>I reckon she was only looking for a lover to burn
<br/><span></span>But I gave her my time for two or three nights
<br/><span></span>Then I put it on pause until the moment was right
<br/><span></span>I went away four months until our paths crossed again
<br/><span></span>She told me "I was never looking for a friend
<br/><span></span>Maybe you could swing by my room around ten
<br/><span></span>Baby, bring the lemon and a bottle of gin
<br/><span></span>We'll be in between the sheets till the late AM"
<br/><span></span>Baby, if you wanted me then should have just said, she's singing<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>Don't fuck with my love
<br/><span></span>That heart is so cold
<br/><span></span>All over my arm
<br/><span></span>I don't wanna know that, babe
<br/><span></span>Don't fuck with my love
<br/><span></span>I told her she knows
<br/><span></span>Take aim and reload
<br/><span></span>I don't wanna know that, babe<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>For a couple weeks I only wanna see her
<br/><span></span>We drink away the days with a takeaway pizza
<br/><span></span>Before a text message was the only way to reach her
<br/><span></span>Now she's staying at my place and loves the way I treat her
<br/><span></span>Singing out Aretha, all over the track like a feature
<br/><span></span>And never wants to sleep, I guess that I don't want to either
<br/><span></span>But me and her, we make money the same way
<br/><span></span>Four cities, two planes, the same day
<br/><span></span>And those shows have never been what it's about
<br/><span></span>But maybe we'll go together and just figure it out
<br/><span></span>I'd rather put on a film with you and sit on a couch
<br/><span></span>But we should get on a plane or we'll be missing it now
<br/><span></span>Wish I'd have written it down, the way that things played out
<br/><span></span>But she was kissing him, how? I was confused about
<br/><span></span>She should figure it out, while I'm sat here singing<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>Don't fuck with my love
<br/><span></span>That heart is so cold
<br/><span></span>All over my arm
<br/><span></span>I don't wanna know that, babe
<br/><span></span>Don't fuck with my love
<br/><span></span>I told her she knows
<br/><span></span>Take aim and reload
<br/><span></span>I don't wanna know that, babe<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>*Knock knock knock* on my hotel door
<br/><span></span>I don't even know if she knows what for
<br/><span></span>She was crying on my shoulder, but I already told ya
<br/><span></span>Trust and respect is what we do this for
<br/><span></span>I never intended to be next
<br/><span></span>But you didn't need to take him to bed, that's all
<br/><span></span>And I never saw him as a threat
<br/><span></span>Until you disappeared with him to have sex, of course
<br/><span></span>It's not like we were both on tour
<br/><span></span>We were staying on the same fucking hotel floor
<br/><span></span>And I wasn't looking for a promise or commitment
<br/><span></span>But it was never just fun, and I thought you were different
<br/><span></span>This is not the way you realized what you wanted
<br/><span></span>It's a bit too much, too late if I'm honest
<br/><span></span>All this time, God knows I'm singing<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>Don't fuck with my love
<br/><span></span>That heart is so cold
<br/><span></span>All over my arm
<br/><span></span>I don't wanna know that, babe
<br/><span></span>Don't fuck with my love
<br/><span></span>I told her she knows
<br/><span></span>Take aim and reload
<br/><span></span>I don't wanna know that, babe<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>Don't fuck with my love
<br/><span></span>That heart is so cold
<br/><span></span>All over my arm
<br/><span></span>I don't wanna know that, babe
<br/><span></span>Don't fuck with my love
<br/><span></span>I told her she knows
<br/><span></span>Take aim and reload
