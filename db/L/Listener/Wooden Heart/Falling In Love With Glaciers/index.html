should of counted days<span><br/></span>And swallowed handfuls of night so she could sleep tight<span><br/></span>And turn her thoughts from its stone cold ways<span><br/></span><span

rot<span><br/></span>Burying herself alive she scrapes the hole that it left open<span><br/></span>Empty as her very heart, that mountain was all broken<span><br/></span>All broken, that mountain was
