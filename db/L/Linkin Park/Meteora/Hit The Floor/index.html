<br/><span></span>Wondering what I think of you and I protect you out of courtesy
<br/><span></span>Too many times that I've held on when I needed to push away
<br/><span></span>Afraid to say what was on my mind, afraid to say what I need to say
<br/><span></span>Too many things that you've said about me when I'm not around
<br/><span></span>You think having the upper hand means you've gotta keep putting me down
<br/><span></span>But I've had too many stand-offs with you, it's about as much as I can stand
<br/><span></span>So I'm waiting util the upper hand is mine<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>One minute you're on top, the next you're not, watch it drop
<br/><span></span>Making your heart stop just before you hit the floor
<br/><span></span>One minute you're on top, the next you're not, missed your shot
<br/><span></span>Making your heart stop, you think you've won and then it's all gone<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>So many people like me put so much trust in all your lies
<br/><span></span>So concerned with what you think to just say what we feel inside
<br/><span></span>So many people like me walk on eggshells all day long
<br/><span></span>All I know is that all I want is to feel like I'm not stepped on
<br/><span></span>There are so many things you say that make me feel you crossed the line
<br/><span></span>What goes up will surely fall and I'm counting down the time
<br/><span></span>'Cause I've had so many stand-offs with you, it's about as much as I can stand
<br/><span></span>So I'm waiting until the upper hand is mine<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>One minute you're on top, the next you're not, watch it drop
<br/><span></span>Making your heart stop just before you hit the floor
<br/><span></span>One minute you're on top, the next you're not, missed your shot
<br/><span></span>Making your heart stop, you think you've won and then it's all gone
<br/><span></span>And then it's all gone; And then it's all gone; And then it's all gone
<br/><span></span>Now it's all gone<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>I know I'll never trust a single thing you say
<br/><span></span>You knew your lies would divide us but you lied anyway
<br/><span></span>And all the lies have got you floating up above us all
<br/><span></span>But what goes up has got to fall<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>One minute you're on top, the next you're not, watch it drop
<br/><span></span>Making your heart stop just before you hit the floor
<br/><span></span>One minute you're on top, the next you're not, missed your shot
<br/><span></span>Making your heart stop, you think you've won and then it's all gone
<br/><span></span>And then it's all gone; And then it's all gone; And then it's all gone
