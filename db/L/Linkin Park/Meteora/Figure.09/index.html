<br/><span></span>Sometimes I wonder why this is happening
<br/><span></span>It's like nothing I could do would distract me when
<br/><span></span>I think of how I shot myself in the back again
<br/><span></span>Because from the infinite words I could say
<br/><span></span>I put all the pain you gave to me on display
<br/><span></span>But didn't realize, instead of setting it free
<br/><span></span>I took what I hated and made it a part of me<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>It never goes away, never goes away<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>And now you've become a part of me, you'll always be right here
<br/><span></span>You've become a part of me, you'll always be my fear
<br/><span></span>I can't separate myself from what I've done
<br/><span></span>Giving up a part of me, I've let myself become you<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>Hearing your name the memories come back again
<br/><span></span>I remember when it started happening
<br/><span></span>I'd see you in every thought I had and then
<br/><span></span>The thoughts slowly found words attached to them
<br/><span></span>And I knew as they escaped away
<br/><span></span>I was committing' myself to them and every day
<br/><span></span>I regret saying those things because now I see
<br/><span></span>That I took what I hated and made it a part of me<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>It never goes away, never goes away<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>And now you've become a part of me, you'll always be right here
<br/><span></span>You've become a part of me, you'll always be my fear
<br/><span></span>I can't separate myself from what I've done
<br/><span></span>Giving up a part of me, I've let myself become you<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>It never goes away, it never goes away
<br/><span></span>It never goes away, it never goes away<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>Get away from me
<br/><span></span>Give me my space back, you got to just go
<br/><span></span>Everything comes down to memories of you
<br/><span></span>I've kept it in but now I'm letting you know
<br/><span></span>I've let you go
<br/><span></span>So get away from me
<br/><span></span>Give me my space back, you got to just go
<br/><span></span>Everything comes down to memories of you
<br/><span></span>I've kept it in but now I'm letting you know
<br/><span></span>I've let you go<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>And now you've become a part of me, you'll always be right here
<br/><span></span>You've become a part of me, you'll always be my fear
<br/><span></span>I can't separate myself from what I've done
<br/><span></span>Giving up a part of me, I've let myself become you
<br/><span></span>I've let myself become you, I've let myself become lost inside these thoughts of you
<br/><span></span>Giving up a part of me, I've let myself become you<br/><span></span><br/><span></span><br/></div><hr/><table><tbody><tr><td>Song name&nbsp;</td><td>Figure.09</td><tr><td>Artist&nbsp;</td><td>Linkin Park</td><tr><td>Album&nbsp;</td><td>Meteora</td></tbody></table></div></div><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/></div><script>var input=document.createElement("input");input.name="q";input.type="search";input.placeholder="Search";document.getElementsByTagName("nav")[0].appendChild(input)</script>
