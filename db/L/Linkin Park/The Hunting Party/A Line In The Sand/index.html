<br/><span></span>We laughed at the sun, we laughed at the guns
<br/><span></span>We laughed at it all
<br/><span></span>And when they, they told us to go
<br/><span></span>We paid them no mind like every other time
<br/><span></span>But little did we know<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>Today, I looked for a sign
<br/><span></span>With flames in my hands
<br/><span></span>A line in the sand between yours and mine
<br/><span></span>And it came like fire from below
<br/><span></span>Your greed led the call, my flag had to fall
<br/><span></span>But little did you know<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>Another day, your truth will come
<br/><span></span>You're gonna pay for what you've
<br/><span></span>Pay for what you've done
<br/><span></span>You'll get what's yours and face your crime
<br/><span></span>You'll tell them, "Give me back what's mine"
<br/><span></span>"Give me back what's mine!"<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>I'd never been a coward, I'd never seen blood
<br/><span></span>You'd sold me an ocean, and I was lost in the flood
<br/><span></span>We were counting on a leader, we were driven by need
<br/><span></span>But couldn't take temptation, and we were blinded by greed<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>You were steady as a sniper, we were waiting on a wire
<br/><span></span>So we never saw it coming when you ran from the fire
<br/><span></span>You can try intimidation and you can try to ignore
<br/><span></span>But when the time comes calling, yeah, you are gonna get yours<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>Another day, your truth will come
<br/><span></span>You're gonna pay for what you've
<br/><span></span>Pay for what you've done
<br/><span></span>You'll get what's yours and face your crime
<br/><span></span>You'll tell them "Give me back what's mine"
<br/><span></span>"Give me back what's mine!"<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>And so today, your truth has come
<br/><span></span>You're gonna pay for what you've
<br/><span></span>Pay for what you've done
<br/><span></span>You'll get what's yours, you're out of time
<br/><span></span>And you will give me back what's mine
<br/><span></span>Give me back what's mine!<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>Give me, give me back what's mine!
<br/><span></span>Give me, give me back what's mine!
<br/><span></span>What's mine!
<br/><span></span>Give me, give me back what's mine!
<br/><span></span>What's mine! What's mine!
<br/><span></span>Give me back what's mine!<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>Today, we stood on the wall
<br/><span></span>We laughed at the sun, we laughed at the guns
<br/><span></span>We laughed at it all
<br/><span></span>And when they, they told us to go
