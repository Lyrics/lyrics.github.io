    <div class="view"><pre>What do I do to ignore them behind me?
Do I follow my instincts blindly?
Do I hide my pride from these bad dreams?
And give in to sad thoughts that are maddening?
Do I sit here and try to stand it
Or do I try to catch them red-handed?
Do I trust some and get fooled by phoniness?
Or do I trust nobody and live in loneliness?
Because I can't hold on when I'm stretched so thin
I make the right moves, but I'm lost within
I put on my daily facade, but then
I just end up getting hurt again by myself

(Myself)
I ask why (But in my mind, I find)
I can't rely on myself (Myself)
I ask why (But in my mind, I find)
I can't rely on myself

I can't hold on (To what I want when I'm stretched so thin)
It's all too much to take in
I can't hold on (To anything, watching everything spin)
With thoughts of failure sinking in

If I turn my back, I'm defenseless
And to go blind leaves you senseless
If I hide my pride and let it all go on
Then they'll take from me 'til everything is gone
And if I let them go, I'll be outdone
But if I try to catch them, I'll be outrun
If I'm killed by the questions like a cancer
Then I'll be buried in the silence of the answer by myself

(Myself)
I ask why (But in my mind, I find)
I can't rely on myself (Myself)
I ask why (But in my mind, I find)
I can't rely on myself

I can't hold on (To what I want when I'm stretched so thin)
It's all too much to take in
I can't hold on (To anything, watching everything spin)
With thoughts of failure sinking in

How do you think I've lost so much?
I'm so afraid, I'm out of touch
How do you expect I will know what to do
When all I know is what you tell me to?

Don't you (Know?)
I can't tell you how to make it (Go)
No matter what I do, how hard I (Try)
I can't seem to convince myself (Why)
I'm stuck on the outside

Don't you (Know?)
I can't tell you how to make it (Go)
No matter what I do, how hard I (Try)
I can't seem to convince myself (Why)
I'm stuck on the outside

I can't hold on (To what I want when I'm stretched so thin)
It's all too much to take in
I can't hold on (To anything, watching everything spin)
With thoughts of failure sinking in

I can't hold on (To what I want when I'm stretched so thin)
It's all too much to take in
I can't hold on (To anything, watching everything spin)
With thoughts of failure sinking...</pre></div>
