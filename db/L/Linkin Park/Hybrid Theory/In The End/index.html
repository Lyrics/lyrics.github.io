<br/><span></span>One thing, I don't know why
<br/><span></span>It doesn't even matter how hard you try
<br/><span></span>Keep that in mind; I designed this rhyme
<br/><span></span>To explain, in due time
<br/><span></span>All I know; time is a valuable thing
<br/><span></span>Watch it fly by as the pendulum swings
<br/><span></span>Watch it count down to the end of the day
<br/><span></span>The clock ticks life away, it's so unreal<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>Didn't look out below
<br/><span></span>Watched the time go right out the window
<br/><span></span>Trying to hold on, but didn't even know
<br/><span></span>I wasted it all just to watch you go
<br/><span></span>I kept everything inside
<br/><span></span>And even though I tried, it all fell apart
<br/><span></span>What it meant to me will eventually be
<br/><span></span>A memory of a time when<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>I tried so hard and got so far
<br/><span></span>But in the end, it doesn't even matter
<br/><span></span>I had to fall to lose it all
<br/><span></span>But in the end, it doesn't even matter<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>One thing, I don't know why
<br/><span></span>It doesn't even matter how hard you try
<br/><span></span>Keep that in mind; I designed this rhyme
<br/><span></span>To remind myself how I tried so hard
<br/><span></span>In spite of the way you were mocking me
<br/><span></span>Acting like I was part of your property
<br/><span></span>Remembering all the times you fought with me
<br/><span></span>I'm surprised it got so (Far)<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>Things aren't the way they were before
<br/><span></span>You wouldn't even recognize me anymore
<br/><span></span>Not that you knew me back then
<br/><span></span>But it all comes back to me in the end
<br/><span></span>You kept everything inside
<br/><span></span>And even though I tried, it all fell apart
<br/><span></span>What it meant to me will eventually be
<br/><span></span>A memory of a time when<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>I tried so hard and got so far
<br/><span></span>But in the end, it doesn't even matter
<br/><span></span>I had to fall to lose it all
<br/><span></span>But in the end, it doesn't even matter<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>I've put my trust in you, pushed as far as I can go
<br/><span></span>For all this, there's only one thing you should know
<br/><span></span>I've put my trust in you, pushed as far as I can go
<br/><span></span>For all this, there's only one thing you should know<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>I tried so hard and got so far
<br/><span></span>But in the end, it doesn't even matter
