    <div class="view"><pre>Water grey
Through the windows, up the stairs
Chilling rain, like an ocean everywhere

Don't want to reach for me, do you?
I mean nothing to you
The little things give you away
And now there will be no mistaking
The levees are breaking

All you've ever wanted
Was someone to truly look up to you
And six feet underwater, I do

Hope decays
Generations disappear
Washed away as a nation simply stares

Don't want to reach for me, do you?
I mean nothing to you
The little things give you away
But now there will be no mistaking
The levees are breaking

All you've ever wanted
Was someone to truly look up to you
And six feet underwater, I do

All you've ever wanted
Was someone to truly look up to you
And six feet underground, now I
Now I do

The little things give you away
The little things give you away
The little things give you away
The little things give you away

(All you've ever wanted was someone to truly look up to you)
The little things give you away, the little things give you away
(All you've ever wanted was someone to truly look up to you)
The little things give you away, the little things give you away
(All you've ever wanted was someone to truly look up to you)
The little things give you away, the little things give you away
(All you've ever wanted was someone to truly look up to you)
The little things give you away, the little things give you away
(All you've ever wanted was someone to truly look up to you)
The little things give you away, the little things give you away
(All you've ever wanted was someone to truly look up to you)
The little things give you away, the little things give you away</pre></div>
