I know it's warm beneath your sheets, and there is ice along the streets, but listen, lover, we will recover. But we've no time to waste with meddling in affairs, we've locked so tightly in our dreams. We are not clean, we are not pure, we will not rest until we're sure. So rob your pretty little eyes of sleep's disguise. I'm at your bedside with a bucket full of lies, so clear your ears and listen. Up, my lady, pack your things, this place is not your home.<span><br/></span><span class="g"><br/></span>And I know what is<span><br/></span><span class="g"><br/></span>And to the glorious past: You've opened my window but broken the glass.

Oh, you must contemplate the current, Boy, and command that coward cease. The boy breathes for his love says, 'I wait.' His love says, 'I wait.' She's shouting out, "I will come back. Yes, I will come back! And I will come. I have lived my life so uncomfortably.
