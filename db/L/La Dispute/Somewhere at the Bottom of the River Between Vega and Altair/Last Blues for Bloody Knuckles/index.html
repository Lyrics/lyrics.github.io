    <div class="view"><pre>"My precious wife
I am in shambles
I am crumbling, I am
Was it something I did
Bid the tide
To climb so high
That it ripped our shore up?

I can fix it, I swear
If you trust me
I am old and I am rusting
But I care, I care"

"My precious wife
We made a promise
Pledged our flesh to be one
How can you doubt a love
That stood so proud as we raised our children?

I believe in
It still
It has faltered, and it is faded
But I know
It's there, it's there.

And how'd it change?
The way you thought of me?
How strange to think we once were lovers
Now we've wrapped the past up in broken glass
And when you speak my name you shudder

Oh precious wife
Please believe this
I'll revive it, I will
We've built a family from this marriage
Why would you tear it apart?"

"Oh, speak now, precious
Your silence screams
You're giving in to failure

Hear me
The promise that you made
Was meant to live forever

Until our deathbed
You're not allowed to change your mind
Was there nothing in that promise?
Are you listening to me?"

"Oh, husband, I could not control it
Husband, I could not abstain
One cannot stop the wind from blowing
Nor refuse the falling rain

Love stirred up a storm inside me
Wrapped its arms around my waist
I failed you
Dear, I'm sorry
Oh, I'm sorry

There was nothing I could do
No, there was nothing I could
Sure as the rain will fall
Some love just fails without a reason"

There is nothing you can do
There is nothing you can do
There is nothing you can do
There is nothing you can do</pre></div>
