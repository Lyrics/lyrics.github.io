lamp on the night stand<span><br/></span>On your mother's side, after midnight, still<span><br/></span>You can see it all, you can see it all<span><br/></span><span class="g"><br/></span>And the closet in the corner<span><br/></span>On the far back shelf with the keepsakes, she hid<span><br/></span>That box there, full of letters of regret<span><br/></span>By the pictures of the kids<span><br/></span><span class="g"><br/></span>You get faint recollections of your<span><br/></span>Mother's sigh, countryside drive<span><br/></span>And the landscape seen from the window of the back seat<span><br/></span>With some flowers in a basket<span><br/></span><span class="g"><br/></span>That afternoon after school<span><br/></span>You and your older sisters<span><br/></span>Found your parents in the kitchen at the table<span><br/></span>Father lifting off the lid of the box<span><br/></span><span class="g"><br/></span>And a hush fell<span><br/></span>Over everything like a funeral prayer<span><br/></span>A reverence, ancestral, heavy in the air<span><br/></span>Though you didn't understand what it meant<span><br/></span><span class="g"><br/></span>That they never said her name aloud around you<span><br/></span>Even sitting at the table with her things they'd kept<span><br/></span>You recall faintly cards, tiny clothes<span><br/></span>And the smell of the paint in the upstairs bedroom<span><br/></span>Until then you didn't know that's what the box had held<span><br/></span><span class="g"><br/></span>Your parents tiptoeing slowly around<span><br/></span>Always speaking in code<span><br/></span><span class="g"><br/></span>No, they never said her name aloud around you<span><br/></span>Only told you it was perfect where your sister went<span><br/></span>And you didn't understand why it hurt them<span><br/></span>So much then that she'd come and left so soon<span><br/></span>Could only guess inside your head at what a "stillbirth" meant<span><br/></span>Only knew that mother wept<span><br/></span><span class="g"><br/></span>You watched while father held her<span><br/></span>Said "Some things come, but can't stay here"<span><br/></span>You saw a brightness, like a light through your eyes<span><br/></span>Closed tight then she tumbled away<span><br/></span><span class="g"><br/></span>From here, some place<span><br/></span>To remain in the night time shadows she made<span><br/></span>To be an absence in mom<span><br/></span>A sadness hanging over her<span><br/></span><span class="g"><br/></span>Like some pentecostal flame<span><br/></span>Drifting on and off<span><br/></span>She was "Sister" only whispered<span><br/></span>Sometimes "Her" or "The Child We Lost"<span><br/></span><span class="g"><br/></span>You were visions<span><br/></span>A vagueness<span><br/></span>A faded image<span><br/></span>You were visions<span><br/></span><span class="g"><br/></span>You were a flame lit<span><br/></span>That burned out twice as brightly<span><br/></span>As the rest of us did<span><br/></span>When you left, you were light<span><br/></span>Then you tumbled away<span><br/></span><span class="g"><br/></span>There are shadows that fall<span><br/></span>Still here at a certain angle<span><br/></span>In the bedroom on the night stand<span><br/></span>By your mother's side<span><br/></span>From the light left on there<span><br/></span><span class="g"><br/></span>There's the box in the closet<span><br/></span>All the things kept<span><br/></span>And the landscape where she left<span><br/></span>Flowers on the grave<span><br/></span>Marble where they etched that name<span><br/></span>And mother cried the whole way home<span><br/></span><span class="g"><br/></span>But she never said it once out loud<span><br/></span>On the way back home from where you thought they meant<span><br/></span>When they said where sister went<span><br/></span><span class="g"><br/></span>After grandpa got hospice sick<span><br/></span>And he couldn't fall sleep<span><br/></span>They wheeled his stretcher bed beside her at night<span><br/></span>And I saw the light<span><br/></span><span class="g"><br/></span>On the day that he died<span><br/></span>By their bed in grandma's eyes<span><br/></span>While us grandkids said our goodbyes<span><br/></span><span class="g"><br/></span>She said, "Don't cry"<span><br/></span>Somewhere he holds her<span><br/></span>And said a name I didn't recognize<span><br/></span>And the light with all the shadows combined...;<br/><br/><br/><hr/><p>Name  THE CHILD WE LOST 1963<br/>Artist  La Dispute<br/>Album  Rooms of the House</p></blockquote></div></div><script>var
