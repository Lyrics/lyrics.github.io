<title>La Dispute â€“ The Surgeon And The Scientist | Lyrics</title>
<meta name="description" content="Don&#x27;t call this an art project / This is science, this is progress / And don&#x27;t pretend these are heartfelt words / We are children dressed as surgeons / But disturbed by the sight of our scars / And now we carry scalpels"/>
