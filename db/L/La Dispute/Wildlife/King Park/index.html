where<span><br/></span>The other shooting was last month<span><br/></span>Or was it last week?<span><br/></span><span class="g"><br/></span>Shots were fired from an SUV<span><br/></span>Heading northbound, Eastown<span><br/></span>The target, a rival<span><br/></span>But they didn't hit the target this time<span><br/></span>They hit a kid we think<span><br/></span>Had nothing to do with it<span><br/></span><span class="g"><br/></span>And I travel backwards<span><br/></span>Through time and space, and<span><br/></span>I disintegrate, become invisible<span><br/></span>I want to see it<span><br/></span>Where I couldn't when it happened<span><br/></span>I want to see it all<span><br/></span>First hand this time<span><br/></span>I want to know what it felt like<span><br/></span><span class="g"><br/></span>So I float behind police lines<span><br/></span>Reconstruct the scene in fragments of memories<span><br/></span>I want to know what his mother looked

the crime scene<span><br/></span><span class="g"><br/></span>Everybody trying to catch a glimpse<span><br/></span>Of what was happening, of what was going on<span><br/></span>Between the ambulance, and all the cop cars<span><br/></span>Everybody gossiping, "Whose kid got hit?<span><br/></span>Where'd it hit him, and who could've fired it?"<span><br/></span>Everybody wondering, "How did it happen again?<span><br/></span>And is he dead?
