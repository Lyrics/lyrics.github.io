class="g"><br/></span>Stumbled and he sputtered, trying to find it back<span><br/></span>Something once so simple gone now<span><br/></span>When he finally gave up, told me<span><br/></span>"Aw, it's like hell getting old"<span><br/></span><span class="g"><br/></span>When you came into the store<span><br/></span>Did you know you'd show me your scars?<span><br/></span><span class="g"><br/></span>I had a heavy heart<span><br/></span>He carried a door<span><br/></span>It's shattered pane all wrapped in plastic<span><br/></span>And he asked if I could fix it<span><br/></span><span class="g"><br/></span>Come by a little later<span><br/></span>Help him put it back on hinges<span><br/></span>"See, I'm far too old to lift it<span><br/></span>And it's not for my house, it's my

flinch<span><br/></span><span class="g"><br/></span>Later I came by<span><br/></span>And backed into the driveway<span><br/></span>Got out to find him waiting there<span><br/></span>To lead me through the side yard<span><br/></span><span class="g"><br/></span>To back behind the house<span><br/></span>Where the door frame stood empty and<span><br/></span>Helped me keep it steady<span><br/></span>While I hammered all the pins in<span><br/></span><span class="g"><br/></span>Then later on the porch<span><br/></span>We somehow got to talking<span><br/></span>He told me of the house<span><br/></span>And how his son is schizophrenic<span><br/></span><span class="g"><br/></span>So they purchased it for him<span><br/></span>The medication working<span><br/></span>And they figured it would help him fit in<span><br/></span>Help him lead a normal life<span><br/></span><span class="g"><br/></span>But the pills made him sleep too much<span><br/></span>And he couldn't keep a job as a result<span><br/></span>So one day he just gave up on taking them<span><br/></span>And that day she had called you<span><br/></span>He'd locked her outside of the house<span><br/></span><span class="g"><br/></span>How quickly did you get there?<span><br/></span>And what were you thinking while walking up?<span><br/></span>What fears flashed in front of you<span><br/></span>Taunted you, walking to unlock the door?<span><br/></span><span class="g"><br/></span>I remember it, Ed<span><br/></span>That story you told me<span><br/></span>Came back clear tonight<span><br/></span>Here while writing<span><br/></span><span class="g"><br/></span>And you should know the feeling never left me<span><br/></span>The weight of my heart<span><br/></span>When you showed me the scars<span><br/></span>On your arms<span><br/></span><span class="g"><br/></span>When I looked in your eyes<span><br/></span>And I heard what you'd said<span><br/></span>How you'd probably would've died<span><br/></span>Were it not for to care<span><br/></span><span class="g"><br/></span>For your daughter and wife<span><br/></span>How he drove in the knife<span><br/></span>Still your son<span><br/></span>How you seemed to look through me<span><br/></span><span class="g"><br/></span>To some old projector screen<span><br/></span>Playing back the scene as you<span><br/></span>Described it on a movie reel<span><br/></span>As real as the minute when it happened<span><br/></span><span class="g"><br/></span>That memory moving behind me<span><br/></span>That moment that changed you for good<span><br/></span><span class="g"><br/></span>And he drove to the house<span><br/></span>And pulled into the driveway<span><br/></span>Got out to his wife<span><br/></span>Waiting, frantic<span><br/></span><span class="g"><br/></span>She'd come by to check<span><br/></span>Found the pillbox was empty<span><br/></span>Went out to the pharmacy<span><br/></span>To fill up his prescription<span><br/></span><span class="g"><br/></span>And came back to a locked door<span><br/></span>And could not get back in<span><br/></span>She'd knocked and she'd knocked<span><br/></span>But he wasn't responding<span><br/></span><span class="g"><br/></span>You put the key into the lock<span><br/></span>And turned it<span><br/></span>Felt the bolt slide away<span><br/></span>Slowly open<span><br/></span><span class="g"><br/></span>Went into the hall<span><br/></span>His son held a knife<span><br/></span>Standing off in the shadows<span><br/></span>Lunged forward and tackled him<span><br/></span><span class="g"><br/></span>Stabbing him over and over<span><br/></span>And breaking that window<span><br/></span>He fled up the staircase<span><br/></span>The ambulance came<span><br/></span><span class="g"><br/></span>Stitched and filled him with blood<span><br/></span>While the cops took his son<span><br/></span>With his wires so tangled<span><br/></span>His father was a stranger<span><br/></span><span class="g"><br/></span>And I sit in my apartment<span><br/></span>I'm getting no answers<span><br/></span>I'm finding no peace<span><br/></span>No release from the anger<span><br/></span><span class="g"><br/></span>I leave it at arms length<span><br/></span>I'm keeping my distance<span><br/></span>From hotels and
