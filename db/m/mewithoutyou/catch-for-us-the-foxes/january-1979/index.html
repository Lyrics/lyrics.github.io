(If could be your servant)<br/>If I could become the servant of all, no lower place to fall. (If I could be your servant)<br/>If I could become the servant of all, no lower place to fall. (If could be your servant)<br/>If I could become the servant of all, no lower place to fall. (If I could be your servant)</p><p>You watch me like a ten car highway wreck with detached, vulgar curiosity.<br/>This looking down at the tops of the hats of us passers-by from your 7th floor balcony.<br/>From such a height you missed creatures too small for sight carry on covert conversations.<br/>And the misguided insects crown me their grasshopper king with a dance of celebration.</p><p>After years with a crown on my head, I've grown overfed, unconcerned and comfortably numb.<br/>Kept busy indulging in the pleasures of the wealthy.<br/>(Someone make me afraid of what I've become!)<br/>At the first sign of possible sorrow, I turned my heels and ran.<br/>(Oh, I'll never learn.)<br/>My life is a cup of sugar I've borrowed before time began and forgot to return.</p><p>It was a matter of time--I always said I could see so now I'm going blind. (I could be your servant)<br/>It was a matter of time--I always said I could see so now I'm going blind. (If I could be your servant)<br/>It was a matter of time--I always said I could see so now I'm going blind. (I could be your servant)<br/>It was a matter of miserable time-- but I heard somewhere there was a cure for useless eyes? (If I could be your servant)</p></article></div>
