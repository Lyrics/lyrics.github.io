You... are my angel
Come from way above
To bring me love (to bring me love)

Her eyes... she's on the dark side...
Neutralise... (every man inside) Every man inside...

Love you, love you, love you, love you,
Love you, love you, love you, love you,
Love you, love you, love you, love you...

You... are my angel
Come from way above

Love you, love you, love you, love you,
Love you, love you, love you, love you,
Love you, love you, love you, love you...
