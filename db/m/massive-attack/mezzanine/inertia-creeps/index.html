<title>Massive Attack â€“ Inertia Creeps | Lyrics</title>
<meta name="description" content="Recollect me darling, raise me to your lips / Two undernourished egos, four rotating hips / Hold on to me tightly, I'm a sliding scale / Can't endure, then you can't inhale / Clearly, out of body experience interferes / And dreams of flying I fit nearly / Surrounds me though I get lonely / Slowly, moving up slowly, inertia keeps, she's moving up slowly / Slowly, moving up slowly, inertia creeps, moving up slowly / She comes, moving up slowly, she comes, moving up slowly / Inertia creeps, moving up slowly / She comes, moving up slowly, she comes, moving up slowly / In my home no chrome as clear as / See me now where my nearest tear is / Been there when I'm over careering / Room shifting is endearing / Between us is our kitchen / When she found my irritant's itchin' / Been here before, been here forever / Moving up slowly, inertia keeps, moving up slowly / Inertia creeps, moving up slowly, inertia keeps, moving up slowly / She comes, moving up slowly, moving up slowly / She comes, moving up slowly, inertia creeps, moving up slowly / She comes / I make no sound in my Eiderdown / Awake I lie and the morning's blue / Room is still, my antenna in you / Nylon burns the bedspread, we're two / Gravity's zero, see me stall / I bounce off walls, lose my footing and fall / It can be sweet though incomplete though / And the frames will freeze, see me on all fours / It's been a long time / She comes, she comes / I want to X you, she comes / I want to X you, she comes / I want to X you / Caught your radio waves / I caught your radio waves, will you take a string? / Say you string me along, say you string me along / Say inertia creeps. Inertia creeps and she comes / Say she comes, say she comes, say she comes, say she comes / ____________________ / Name Inertia Creeps / Artist Massive Attack / Album Mezzanine"/>
