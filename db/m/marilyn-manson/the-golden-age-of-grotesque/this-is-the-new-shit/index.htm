<div><pre>Everything has been said before
There's nothing left to say anymore
When it's all the same, you can ask for it by name

Babble, babble, bitch, bitch
Rebel, rebel, party, party
Sex, sex, sex and don't forget the violence
Blah, blah, blah, got your lovey-dovey, sad-and-lonely
Stick your stupid slogan in
Everybody sing along
Babble, babble, bitch, bitch
Rebel, rebel, party, party
Sex, sex, sex and don't forget the violence
Blah, blah, blah, got your lovey-dovey, sad-and-lonely
Stick your stupid slogan in
Everybody sing

Are you motherfuckers ready for the new shit?
Stand up and admit tomorrow's never coming
This is the new shit
Stand up and admit
Do we get it?  "No!"
Do we want it?  "Yeah!"
This is the new shit
Stand up and admit

Babble, babble, bitch, bitch
Rebel, rebel, party, party
Sex, sex, sex and don't forget the violence
Blah, blah, blah, got your lovey-dovey, sad-and-lonely
Stick your stupid slogan in
Everybody sing along
Everything has been said before
There's nothing left to say any more
When it's all the same
You can ask for it by name

Are you motherfuckers ready for the new shit?
Stand up and admit tomorrow's never coming
This is the new shit
Stand up and admit
Do we get it?  "No!"
Do we want it?  "Yeah!"
This is the new shit
Stand up and admit

And now it's "you know who"
I got the you know what
I stick it you know where
You know why; you don't care
And now it's "you know who"
I got the you know what
I stick it you know where
You know why; you don't care

And now it's "you know who"
I got the you know what
I stick it you know where
You know why; you don't care
And now it's "you know who"
I got the you know what
I stick it you know where
You know why; you don't care

Babble, babble, bitch, bitch
Rebel, rebel, party, party
Sex, sex, sex and don't forget the violence
Blah, blah, blah, got your lovey-dovey, sad-and-lonely
Stick your stupid slogan in
Everybody sing

Are you motherfuckers ready for the new shit?
Stand up and admit tomorrow's never coming
This is the new shit
Stand up and admit
Do we get it?  "No!"
Do we want it? - "Yeah!"
This is the new shit
Stand up and admit

So, let us entertain you
So, let us entertain you
So, let us entertain you

Blah, blah, blah, blah everybody sing along</pre></div>
