I see through bitter eyes and
The fact still remains
I read between your lies
You got beat at your own game
Take a trip with me for soon
I will sin
Without one regret
The pain will begin

As the knife got deeper
I won't go without a fight
But you know the price you'll pay
That price is with your life
Suffering and pain like nothing
In your past
I walk the walk, and my path
will be your last

Repeat 1st verse
Repeat 1st chorus
