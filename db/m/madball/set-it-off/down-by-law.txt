You wake up every morning
In this living hell
Not knowing that
You're worst enemy is me
You never know what can happen
Within this cell
Betrayal is what I feel
Revenge is what I seek

No hesitation, no turning back
I gotta do it, I have no choice
Gotta do what I
Gotta do for the crew
Down by law
What you did I can't
Forgive my so called brother
I can't let my feelings
get in the way

Why you turn your back
On the crew
We always had your back
We'd die for you
You ratted on your boy
Something you never do
Now his life is over
And yours is too

Down by law
We made a promise to eachother
A promise that you choose to break
We stuck together no matter what
My brother
You turned you're back
And proved you're fake

Repeat 2nd verse

Down by law
You've left me no choise
The strenght of a gesture
A thought with no voice

Repeat chorus

The clock is ticking
You're time is up
Now's my chance, I gotta move fast
Our memories I put to rest
It's the law we chose to live by
You broke the fuckin' rules
You must die
Why
