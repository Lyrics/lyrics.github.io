    <div class="view"><pre>Our friends are all hurting
From moments and regrets and charity laced with a lie
And still we keep hoping
To fix all the defects and strengthen these Seminal ties

We go on together
For better or worse, our history is too real to hate
Now and forever
We stay until morning, and promise to fight for our fates

'Til we die
'Til we die

The start of the journey
Is every bit worth it, I can't let you down anymore
The sky is still clearing
We're never afraid and the consequence opens the door

I've never stopped trying
I've never stopped feeling like family is much more than blood
Don't go on without me
The piece that I represent compliments each and every one

'Til we die
'Til we die
We won't be forgotten, we'll never give in
This war we've achieved has allowed us to win

'Til we die
'Til we die

My last true confession
Will open your eyes, I've never known trust like the nine
Let it be spoken
Let it be screamed, they'll never ever take us alive

'Til we die
'Til we die
We won't be forgotten, we'll never give in
This war we've achieved has allowed us to win
Carry on
Carry on

(We'll never be broken, we won't be denied
Our war is the pressure, we need to unite
We'll never be broken, we won't be denied
Our war is the pressure, we need to unite)

'Til we die
'Til we die
We won't be forgotten, we'll never give in
This war we've achieved has allowed us to win
Carry on
Carry on

We'll never be broken, we won't be denied
Our war is the pressure, we need to unite
'Til we die
'Til we die

'Til we die (we won't be forgotten, we'll never give in)
'Til we die (this war we've achieved has allowed us to win)
'Til we die (we'll never be broken, we won't be denied)
'Til we die (our war is the pressure, we need to unite)</pre></div>
