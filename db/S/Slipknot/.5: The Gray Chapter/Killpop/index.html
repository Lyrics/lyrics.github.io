    <div class="view"><pre>She's sticking needles in her skin
I turn with an ugly grin
Her canvas doesn't leave a lot to fantasy

But her peace of mind can't stay inside the lines
It's so confusing, the methods that she's using
She knows she shouldn't leave a mark that I can see

Will she ever find, one million of a kind?
It's cold and lonely but that's because she told me
Lost inside her dirty world
No one hurts this pretty girl but her

Oh, she's beautiful
A little better than a man deserves
Ooh, I'm not insane
Please tell me she won't change

Maybe I should let her go
But only when she loves me (She loves me)
How can I just let her go?
Not until she loves me (She loves me)

She's drowning in herself again
My God, what a lovely sin
I guess there's nothing left to do but have my way

She can feel it's right, so she doesn't close her eyes
She smiles and answers; it doesn't seem to matter
Lost inside my dirty head
Something tells me I'm the one who's kept

Loud, so volatile
A little better than her mind defiled
Who I need to be
Please tell me she won't change

Maybe I should let her go
But only when she loves me (She loves me)
How can I just let her go?
Not until she loves me (She loves me)

We were meant to be together
Now die and fucking love me
We were made to hate each other
Now die and fucking love me

Die and fucking love me
Die and fucking love me
Die and fucking love me</pre></div>
