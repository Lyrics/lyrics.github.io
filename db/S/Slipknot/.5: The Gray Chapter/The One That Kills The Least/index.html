    <div class="view"><pre>I don't seem to care today
I mirror what I love with what I hate
Empty ways can cloud your eyes
I only know because I tried

So come with me, come with me
Let's meet our contestants
There's no better time to play the game

I don't want to give it away
Underneath the citadels
Buried deep with your guilt and regrets
Leading in the dark, everything is wonderful
I don't care, I don't want to forget

Why is it a crime? It's none of your business
I prefer to be in hell by myself
Turn the other cheek and tell it to somebody who
Refuses to forgive when nothing was taken

No one else survives
I've seen you live, now watch me die
But we don't see the writing on the wall
And as I close my eyes
Alone in here, I realize
The one that kills the least still kills us all

Hidden in the rubble
Everybody's got a story to tell
What do I need? Eliminate the possible
All that's left is a man in a cell

Maybe I'm wrong, maybe a decision is
The better way to go, the better way to be
I've got my demons, go get your own
Save another number, don't forget to hate me

No one else survives
I've seen you live, now watch me die
But we don't see the writing on the wall
And as I close my eyes
Alone in here, I realize
The one that kills the least still killed us all

No one else survives
I've seen you live, now watch me die
But we don't see the writing on the wall
And as I close my eyes
Lost in here, I realize
The one that kills the least still kills us all

The one that kills the least still kills us all
The one that kills the least still kills us all
All, all, all</pre></div>
