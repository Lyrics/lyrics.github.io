    <div class="view"><pre>Let's skip all the histrionics
Not again, not another excuse
The epidemic is co-dependent
Biting off more than your mouth can chew

Don't forget to convalesce your secrets
I don't want to be a man today
For all you know I'm the silver in the bullet
I am the trigger that will make you all obey

I'm going to make you cry tonight
I'm going to make you hate me

Inside all my flaws again (I can't let go)
In spite of you I'm lost again (I still don't know)
Disguises show me, what am I if I am only?
The status quo is not a punishment, but now it feels like home

Your association finds you guilty
Starting with the end of the day
Black and white is such a fascist feeling
Right or wrong and nothing to say

The last good bipeds cleaning up the fingerprints
Unappreciated medical fiends
Confiscate another classic inbred
Fuck it all, light the acetylene

No other choice, I can't explain
Life keeps taking things away

Inside all my flaws again (I can't let go)
In spite of you I'm lost again (I still don't know)
Disguises show me, what am I if I am only?
The status quo is not a punishment, but now it feels like home

The tough guys who came to kill, but stayed to rape and ravage.

The future's here, I'm past my prime
When the evidence came, I committed the crime
Can you stand on your faith with your feet on the bible
Who could ask for a better disciple

What's the point, I'm not sure I can
I'll never dig another grave, I'm afraid of what I'll find
If it hurts, then you're too old
I'll take your shit and give you fucking gold

I'm going to make you cry tonight
I need you to hate me

Inside all my flaws again (I can't let go)
In spite of you I'm lost again (I still don't know)
This life has shown me, why am I here? Sad and lonely
The status quo is not a punishment, but now it feels like home

But now it feels like home</pre></div>
