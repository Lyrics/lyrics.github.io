    <div class="view"><pre>Come on!

Here we go again, motherfucker!

Yeah!

Come on down and see the idiot right here
Too fucked to beg and not afraid to care
What's the matter with calamity anyway?
Right? Get the fuck outta my face
Understand that I can't feel anything
It isn't like I wanna sift through the decay
I feel like a wound, like I've got a fucking
Gun against my head, you live when I'm dead!

One more time, motherfucker!

Everybody hates me now, so fuck it...
Blood's on my face and my hands and I don't know why
I'm not afraid to cry, but that's none of your business!
Whose life is it? Get it? See it? Feel it? Eat it!
Spin it around so I can spit in its face
I wanna leave without a trace
Cause I don't wanna die in this place!

People equal shit!
People equal shit!
People equal shit!
People equal shit!

People equal shit!
Whatcha gonna do?
People equal shit!
Cause I'm not afraid of you!
People equal shit!
I'm everything you'll never be!
People equal shit!
Yeah!

Yeah!

Come on!

It never stops, you can't be everything to everyone
Contagion; I'm sitting at the side of Satan
What do you want from me?
They never told me the failure I was meant to be
Yeah? Overdo it; Don't tell me; You blew it?
Stop your bitching and fight your way through it

I'm not like you, I just fuck up
Come on motherfucker, everybody has to die
Come on motherfucker, everybody has to die!

People equal shit!

People equal shit!
People equal shit!
People equal shit!
People equal shit!

People equal shit!
(Yeah!)
People equal shit!
(Yeah!)
People equal shit!
(Yeah!)
People equal shit!
(Oh!)

People equal shit!
People equal shit!
People equal shit!
People equal shit!

People equal shit!
Whatcha gonna do?
People equal shit!
Cause I'm not afraid of you!
People equal shit!
I'm everything you'll never be!
People equal shit!
Yeah!
Goddammn right!</pre></div>
