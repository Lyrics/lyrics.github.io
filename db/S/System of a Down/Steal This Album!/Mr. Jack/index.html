Is that the mouth wash in your eyes?
Hey Mr. Jack
Is that the cause of your surprise?
Hey where you at?
On the side of the freeway in the car
Hey where you at?
On the side of the freeway in the car
In the car
On the side of the freeway in the...

Hey Mr. Jack
Is that the trick of your disguise?

Hey Mr. Jack
Is that the cause of your demise?

Hey where you at?
On the side of the freeway in the car
Hey where you at?
On the side of the freeway in the car
In the car

On the side of the freeway in the car
In the car

On the side of the freeway in the...

Wake up...

Seven a.m. morning came to take us away
Little men, big guns pointing at our heads
Seven a.m. morning came to take us away
Little men, big guns pointing at our, heads
At our, at our heads

Your prospect of living gone
You ran the light at dawn
Protectors on your back
Lights are on their track

You must now face authority
You're nothing like me
You must now face authority
You're nothing like me

Put your hands up, get out of the car
Put your hands up, get out of the car
Put your hands up, get out of the car

Fuck you pig
Fuck you pig
Fuck you pig
Fuck you pig

Put your hands up, get out of the car

SONG MEANING: "Mr. Jack" is an alcoholic pulled over for driving under the influence. It's not actually anti-authority as commonly believed.</pre></div>
