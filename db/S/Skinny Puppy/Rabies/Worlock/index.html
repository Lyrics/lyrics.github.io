    <div class="view"><pre>(Now is the only thing that's real)

Binge, cringe, cringe, binge, sloppy
Binge, cringe,
(The police used to watch over the people,
Now they're watching the people)
Sloppy, mincing, eyedropping, biopsy.
Cyclops overlooks optic options.
Rotton, showstopper, skinpopper.
Babbler dabbler.
Self-confessed criminal.
Tore pen in vain.
Instant, still spellbound.
Game stock, talk back rock.
Reencounter incident.
Subsistance is inexistant.
(Now is the only thing that's real)
Non committed, unwitted, oblivious.
Habitual resistor.
Roughed up edge, fluent nudge, pre-collect ignition.
Motivation inexistant.

Wasted views,
That's all they see blue,
Hot blood, guilt, optic nerve.
With the right attitude you will succeed, blue.
Self-abusive recluse, too late for me.
Make shifting peace unsettling.
Crazy... doing crazy things.
Keep your eyes open, soft-spoken change nothing.
A view so cruel.
(a few)

Dogs body comatose, torchlight roast.
Disinterest. Disinfect.
Retold, impressed by possession.
Insiders know, refresh, detained contest.
All that is pure, sure tonight, freeze in time.
Shadows climb, distractions override.
Instincts evolve, over and over.
Why can't you see this?

(Do you, don't you want me to make you?
Coming down fast but don't let me brake you.
Only tell me tell me the answer.
You may be a lover but you ain't no dancer)

Wasted truth.
Why call it all, blue?
Hot lines.
Eventual decline.
With the right attitude you will succeed, blue.
Resent that discontent.
Sidestep.
Define the state of things so far.
Crazy things, soft spoken.. Override.
With your eyes open, you know soft-spoken changes nothing.
A view so cruel.
Nothing.

A view so cruel (a view so cruel)
A view so cruel (a view so cruel)
A view so cruel (a view so cruel)
A view so cruel (a view so cruel)
A view so cruel (a view so cruel)
A view so cruel (a view so cruel)

Try and take over, over the fringe.
Sloppy, eyesore, rotten, showstopper, skinpopper.
A babbler and dabbler.
Oh, change, change!
Nothing.
Nothing, so, no, nothing.
Go, down.
Go.

(Now is the only thing that's real)
