MC's, you better look over your shoulder
Yeah, you know we on and on, oh well now

'Nough of them have come and them all try dog we out
Born down pill, we are the roughneck scouts
Music we make for make the crowd jump up
Crowd get hyped, explode and erupt
Blend up the ragga metal punk hip-hop
Unity sound killer groove non-stop
In, ah, for this place also the strong will survive
Strength and power are gon' keep them alive

My sound, we come to take over
MC's, you better look over your shoulder
Yeah you know we on and on, oh well now
Skindred we in, ah, your area
Bring the rockers, you know we superior
Yeah, you know we on and on...

Nobody gets out of this shark pit alive
Nobody, nobody gets out alive
Nobody gets out of this shark pit alive
Nobody, nobody gets out alive
obody gets out of this shark pit alive
Come follow me, one and two and sixty seven and forty three and
Nobody gets out of this shark pit alive
Nobody, nobody gets out alive
Nobody gets out of this shark pit alive
Nobody, nobody gets out alive!
Nobody gets out of this shark pit alive
Nobody, nobody gets out alive!

Some of them have come and them have try flex with this
Show them the ragga punk power, watch them head twist
Sting like a scorpion, buzz like an E
Full force of fis,t it a'gon' drop plenty!
This is what we want and you have got to know
If you think you're hard star, come and have a go

My sound we come to take over
MC's, you better look over your shoulder
Yeah, you know we on and on, oh well now
Skindred we in, ah, your area
Bring the rockers, you know we superior
Yeah, you know we on and on...

Nobody gets out of this shark pit alive
Nobody, nobody gets out alive
Nobody gets out of this shark pit alive
Nobody, nobody gets out alive
Nobody gets out of this shark pit alive
Come follow me, one and two and sixty seven and forty three and
Nobody gets out of this shark pit alive
Nobody gets out of this shark pit alive
