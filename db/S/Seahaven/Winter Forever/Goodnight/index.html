    <div class="view"><pre>Goodnight my love, my lovely love
God damn shame to be a traitor
I've got God in a shoebox under
My bed waiting for my finger

We both look better in the dark
So I'll do it while we're sleeping
That way I will not reflect
My father's defining features

The absence of consciousness
Welcomes the presence of
Formulated manipulation, no
And I won't feel a thing if you do not

Feel what I feel and you'll find faith to believe in
God I need you, because I'm familiar with the devil
And I've been waiting for the sun to come to dry up all this rain
But I'm caught out in the storm

It's three a.m., I've got you good
I've got you right where I want you
And it must be easy to hold your tongue now
With help from a forty-five

"Next exit, one mile", it read
But you're moving a mile a minute
That gives you around sixty seconds
Before you reach your destination

So where, oh where, where will you go?
And I won't feel a thing if you don't, you don't, no
So where, oh where, where will you go?
Oh, I won't feel a thing if you do not

Feel what I feel and you'll find faith to believe in
God I need you, because I'm familiar with the devil
And I've been waiting for the sun to come to dry up all this rain
But I'm caught out in the storm

Your safety came with distance
But you foolishly fell into consistency
Place your hand where it does not belong
And I'll be a reminder of your size

Your steady way mirrors the end
The vibrance that fills the pillow behind the head
The one you chose to live within
The one that said, that one that says

Feel what I feel and you'll find faith to believe in
God I need you, because I'm familiar, familiar oh
(With the devil, with the devil, with the devil, with the devil)
And I've been waiting for the sun to come to dry up all this rain
(With the devil)
And I'm still waiting</pre></div>
