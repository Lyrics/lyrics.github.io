"i drank water from the sink, do you think thats okay?" "i really dont think its safe to go outside today." "this is what happens when we dont pray" increase the insanity - they have us right where they want us. by our heads and by our wallets. another day in locked in paradise. theres nothing to see here so just close your eyes. - substance abuse declines while the war on drugs intensifies. you dont have to agree. this is called better safe than sorry. life through western eyes. too fat too ugly you will amount to nothing you better pick the pace or you'll be stuck on the side lines life through western eyes. - this is life through western eyes - life through western eyes - so you better not think just sit back and take another drink why swim when we can sink increase the insanity<span><br/></span><div id="metadata">Name  Life Through Western Eyes<br/>Artist  Stick To Your Guns<br/>Album  The Hope Division</div></blockquote></div>
