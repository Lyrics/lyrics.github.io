    <div class="view"><pre>Storming through the party like my name is El Ni√±o
When I'm a hangin' out drinking in the back of an El Camino
As a kid, was a skid, and no one knew me by name
Crashed my own house party 'cause nobody came

I know I'm not the one you thought you knew back in high school
Never going, never showing up when we had to
Attention that we crave, don't tell us to behave
I'm sick of always hearing "act your age"

I don't want to waste my time
Become another casualty of society
I'll never fall in line
Become another victim of your conformity and back down

Because you don't
Know us at all we laugh when old people fall
But what would you expect with a conscience so small
Heavy metal and mullets is how we were raised
Maiden and Priest were the gods that we praised

'Cause we like having fun at other peoples expenses
Cutting people down is just a minor offense and
Its none of your concern, I guess I'll never learn
I'm sick of being told to wait my turn

I don't want to waste my time
Become another casualty of society
I'll never fall in line
Become another victim of your conformity and back down

Don't count on me, to let you know when
Don't count on me, I'll do it again
Don't count on me, it's the point you're missin'
Don't count on me, cause I'm not listenin'

Well I'm a no-goodnick lower middle class brat
Back-packed and I don't give a shit about nothing
You be standing on the corner talking all that kumuppin
But you don't make sense from all the gas you be huffing
Then if the egg don't stain you'll be ringing off the hook
You're on the hit list wanted in the telephone book
I like songs with distortion, to drink in proportion
The doctor said my mom should have had an abortion
(Abortion, abortion, abortion)

I don't want to waste my time
Become another casualty of society
I'll never fall in line
Become another victim of your conformity and back down
(Waste my time with them)
Causality of society
(Waste my time again)
Victim of your conformity and back down</pre></div>
