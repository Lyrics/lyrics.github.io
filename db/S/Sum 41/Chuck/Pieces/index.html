    <div class="view"><pre>I tried to be perfect,
But nothing was worth it,
I don't believe it makes me real.
I thought it'd be easy,
But no one believes me,
I meant all the things I said.

If you believe it's in my soul,
I'd say all the words that I know,
Just to see if it would show,
That I'm trying to let you know,
That I'm better off on my own.

This place is so empty,
My thoughts are so tempting,
I don't know how it got so bad.
Sometimes it's so crazy,
that nothing could save me,
But it's the only thing that I have.

If you believe it's in my soul,
I'd say all the words that I know,
Just to see if it would show,
That I'm trying to let you know,
That I'm better off on my own.

(On my own!)


I tried to be perfect,
It just wasn't worth it,
Nothing could ever be so wrong.
It's hard to believe me,
It never gets easy,
I guess I knew that all along.

If you believe it's in my soul,
I'd say all the words that I know,
Just to see if it would show,
That I'm trying to let you know,
That I'm better off on my own.</pre></div>
