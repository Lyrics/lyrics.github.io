    <div class="view"><pre>All of us believe that
This is not up to you
The fact of the matter is
That it's up to me

Hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey
Let's go

How can we fake this anymore (anymore)
We turn our backs away and choose to just ignore (Choose to just ignore)
(Some say) Some say it's ignorance
It makes me feel some innocence
It takes away a part of me
That I won't let go of

Tell me why can't you see it's not the way (not the way)
When we all fall down, it won't be too late
Why is there no reason we can't change
When we all fall down, who will take the blame
Will it take

Nothing could ever be this real (be this real)
A life unsatisfied that I could never feel (I could never feel)
(Some say) This future's not so bright
Some can't make the sacrifice
It's much more than just black and white
And I won't follow

Tell me why can't you see it's not the way (not the way)
When we all fall down, it won't be too late
Why is there no reason, we can't change
When we all fall down, who will take the blame
Will it take

Times like these I've come to see how
Everything but time is running out

Hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey
What

All of us believe in what we need
What we have's what we don't see

Tell me why can't you see it's not the way (not the way)
When we all fall down, it won't be too late
Why is there no reason, we can't change
When we all fall down, who will take the blame
Who will it take

Tell me why can't you see it's not the way (not the way)
(So how long has this gone on, I don't see this ending)
When we all fall down it won't be too late
(It's too late, we can't change what has now begun)
Why is there no reason we can't change
(We have time, it's not right, why are we pretending)
When we all fall down, who will take the blame
(We fit along, for so long)
Will it take
(We knew this all along)</pre></div>
