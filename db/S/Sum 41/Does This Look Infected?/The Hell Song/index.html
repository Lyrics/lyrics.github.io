    <div class="view"><pre>Everybody's got their problems
Everybody says the same thing to you
It's just the matter how you solve them
And knowing how to change the things you've been through
I feel I've come to realize
How fast life can be compromised
Step back to see what's going on
I can't believe this happened to you
This happened to you

It's just a problem that I'm faced with
Am I not the only one who hates to stand by
Complications headed first in this line
With all these pictures running through my mind
Knowing endless
Consequences
I feel so useless in this
Get back, step back and as for me
I can't believe

Part of me, won't agree
Cause I don't know if it's for sure
Suddenly, suddenly
I don't feel so insecure
Part of me, won't agree
Cause I don't know if it's for sure
Suddenly, suddenly
I don't feel so insecure
Anymore

Everybody's got their problems
Everybody says the same thing to you
It's just the matter how you solve them
But what else are we supposed to do

Part of me, won't agree
Cause I don't know if it's for sure
Suddenly, suddenly
I don't feel so insecure
Part of me, won't agree
Cause I don't know if it's for sure
Suddenly, suddenly
I don't feel so insecure
(Anymore)
Why do things that matter the most
Never end up being what we chose
(Anymore)
Now that I find hell ain't so bad
I don't think I knew what I had
(Anymore)
Why do things that matter the most
Never end up being what we chose
(Anymore)
Now that I find hell ain't so bad
I don't think I knew what I had</pre></div>
