<br/><span></span>Now everybody's like pick a card, any card
<br/><span></span>If I shot my full load with the first hand I played
<br/><span></span>I'd be a monkey in a box hangin' with the David Blaines
<br/><span></span>I be swimmin' with the sharks, mouths full of razor blades
<br/><span></span>But I'm not, I got out of that game<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>Escape Artist<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>I talk 'til I'm red in my face with strain polyps
<br/><span></span>I'll rock 'til I'm out of my range then raise octaves
<br/><span></span>I play through the pain and remain conscience
<br/><span></span>Refraining from commenting on the lame compliments
<br/><span></span>And the petty criticisms from those who ain't accomplished
<br/><span></span>Even one fifths of some of this shit I made progress with
<br/><span></span>I'm leaving naysayers stumped like rain forests
<br/><span></span>After years of pullin' rabit ears out my pants pockets
<br/><span></span>I'm not revealin' any tricks of the trade
<br/><span></span>It's just there ain't no magic in the breakdown baby<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>In an effort to make 'em all see what I found in my life I decided to give 'em a look
<br/><span></span>none of 'em gave it a glimpse and I guess that I'm sitting in the middle of an unread book

<br/><span></span>but the sentences descend on their own and the wording is permanent
<br/><span></span>never been missed
<br/><span></span>I've just been mis-
<br/><span></span>worded and mis-
<br/><span></span>interpreted, it's
<br/><span></span>funny how serving a sentence of solitary confinement
<br/><span></span>results in the death sentences filling my running assignment
<br/><span></span>I'm just wondering where my time went, it pulled a disappearing act
<br/><span></span>and every single assistant I ever had got sawed in half<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>You See I never payed attention
<br/><span></span>But I can't afford to laugh
<br/><span></span>'cause I'm lookin' for my break in an autograph for my CAST
<br/><span></span>but I'm short on staff so all I ask is volunteers in the crowd
<br/><span></span>show a little bit of audience participation now<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>When I say hip (what do I say?)
<br/><span></span>You, you say shut the fuck up we ain't sayin shit!
<br/><span></span>And I'll respect it
<br/><span></span>Check it,
<br/><span></span>In a flair for the dramatic exit
<br/><span></span>A fashionable entrance
<br/><span></span>Late to my own arraignment (Oh!)
<br/><span></span>The self-destructive things that I do for entertainment
<br/><span></span>My folks gave me this already broken heart as my pallet
<br/><span></span>While I was out honing my craft you was disowning your talent
<br/><span></span>That's why you still live at home
<br/><span></span>And I bought this house off my parents
<br/><span></span>I'm getting ahead of myself
<br/><span></span>(gettin ahead of myself)
<br/><span></span>I see the hair on my back
<br/><span></span>(see the hair on my back)
<br/><span></span>I'm on the road reading Kerouac
<br/><span></span>It's poems versus better raps
<br/><span></span>I think to myself
<br/><span></span>What's worth remembering
<br/><span></span>Versus defending the size of my manhood or confessional canned goods<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>In an effort to make 'em all see what I found in my life I decided to give 'em a look

<br/><span></span>I clip ya wings to fit you in head shrinking magician
<br/><span></span>Shape-shifting reptilian turned body contortionist
<br/><span></span>Orphanages started offering torches to abortion clinics
<br/><span></span>I lost acquaintances
<br/><span></span>And a morgue of lady friends
<br/><span></span>I gender bent the heaven sent angelic devil boy with God's androgynous
<br/><span></span>I'm lookin' marvelous but looks can kill
<br/><span></span>And I'm unsure about my sexual orientations still
<br/><span></span>Put me in a special kind of case that only breaks if
<br/><span></span>You hit it with a bouquet of flowers and baby breath arrangement
<br/><span></span>The vault is vacant
<br/><span></span>They're all looking for fault or blame
<br/><span></span>I called my agent
<br/><span></span>The moment that I caught the train
<br/><span></span>I let him know, I'm going nowhere, he's invited
<br/><span></span>If he leaves tonight then he just might help me find it
<br/><span></span>But this is my burden to bare, not his
<br/><span></span>And I'm a psychic without a sidekick
<br/><span></span>Holding the future hostage
