<br/><span></span>Seeing what we all owe
<br/><span></span>Eastside where it's lit at
<br/><span></span>OGs on the corner
<br/><span></span>Talking ‘bout a profit
<br/><span></span>Then the streetlights come on
<br/><span></span>Here come ghouls and the diamonds
<br/><span></span>They gone see what you made of

<br/><span></span>Like the Jesus you mention
<br/><span></span>Did you grow up with an
<br/><span></span>Option of being buddist or christian?
<br/><span></span>Did you wanna go praise him
<br/><span></span>Or was that granny’s decision?
<br/><span></span>They gone judge me 'til death
<br/><span></span>But I'm gone judge you thereafter
