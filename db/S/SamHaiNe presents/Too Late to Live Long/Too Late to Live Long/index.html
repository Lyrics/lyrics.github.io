But, there's no more, no distractions, no time.<span><br/></span>Gotta move, gotta focus.<span><br/></span><span class="g"><br/></span>The handcuff marks around his wrists are itching.<span><br/></span><span class="g"><br/></span>He ignores the late notice on his "Welcome" mat.<span><br/></span>He grabs a backpack and empties what he needs from the dresser: ready to eat meals, ramen, the necessities.<span><br/></span>The setup on his work desk is too impractical to travel. He'll leave that for last.<span><br/></span><span class="g"><br/></span>Broadcasting on one of his monitors is police dispatch:<span><br/></span>"Suspect escaped. White male, 5'10, dark hair. Last seen on Oak and Spruce".<span><br/></span><span class="g"><br/></span>Looks like Frank lost them back at the train station.<span><br/></span>Gives him some extra breathing time.<span><br/></span><span class="g"><br/></span>He sees a rat eating the sandwich he left on the TV table.<span><br/></span>"Fucking rats, you let one live and they'll ruin everything."<span><br/></span><span class="g"><br/></span>He takes a hammer and slams the rodent's head with a crunching sound like crackers in a napkin.<span><br/></span><span class="g"><br/></span>He sits down and looks over his monitors and closes some accounts and transfers some Bitcoin into a proxy he had reserved in case of emergencies.<span><br/></span><span class="g"><br/></span>Frank had been pinched earlier downtown by Oak trying to trade some vials of melanin for a few film reels of sketchy interactions between certain persons of influence and faces of media during one of those "fundraising parties at Bilderberg".<span><br/></span><span class="g"><br/></span>The client was superstitious and paranoid so, they met in person with analog material in hand.<span><br/></span>Sounded just fine to Franco. Physical contraband had more value in its fragility. No fuss, no counterfeit, no malware, no bugs, no viruses.<span><br/></span>Frank's work was commerce and customer service. Illicit materials bought, traded, sold like baseball cards.<span><br/></span>When he wasn't some deep web "Crazy Eddie", he'd mine Bitcoin from a warehouse under a phony name.<span><br/></span><span class="g"><br/></span>The client delivered and as soon as he could touch the envelope, Frank was surrounded by ten guns and nine badges.<span><br/></span><span class="g"><br/></span>Should've never left the Ville. Spooks were probably on the hunt for the film or maybe his hustle; but they couldn't raid the Ville.<span><br/></span>Regardless of that, the common denominator was this rat-faced fuck who set him up.<span><br/></span><span class="g"><br/></span>So the screws roughed him up and Frank called them every which thing but Lucy: "Motherfuckers, Pig Cunts, Shit Micks, Freckled-Kiks, Spic-Fuck-Dog-Faced-Niggers", the whole lexicon of insults he could sweat between his teeth.<span><br/></span><span class="g"><br/></span>They tossed him into the paddy wagon, cuffed from behind and slammed the door. And he slid around into both sides of the van with every wild and on-purpose turn on the highway.<span><br/></span><span class="g"><br/></span>Fortunately, Frank kept a handcuff key tucked up in his gums and got loose.<span><br/></span>Then he slipped out whatever needed hidden in his sneaker soles and popped the backdoor open, jumping from a vehicle going 65mph and making a break for it.<span><br/></span><span class="g"><br/></span>Frank woke up the girl who was still passed out on his bed.<span><br/></span>"Get your shit in bag and split", he said. Pushing her out the door and tossing her things into the stairwell.<span><br/></span><span class="g"><br/></span>She calls him a, "piece of shit, dickless, computer nerd who can't fuck anyways".<span><br/></span><span class="g"><br/></span>Frank gets his go-bag and waits for the bitch to leave the premises. Hoping - no one paid attention to some cracked out whore in the building.<span><br/></span><span class="g"><br/></span>Nothing.<span><br/></span>Good.<span><br/></span><span class="g"><br/></span>Frank showers after destroying all his files, CDs, hardware, and burning everything analog and paperwork in the apartment. Cold shower calmed him.<span><br/></span>He sits on the sofa with his bag on his lap and listens to the rain.<span><br/></span>"Don't rest, gotta go. Stay on point. Focused. Get on your feet. Maybe a few seconds. Clock's ticking, running out. No more sand, wind and rain. Stay focused. Breathe. No time."<span><br/></span>Franky nods out.<span><br/></span><span class="g"><br/></span>When he opens his eyes an hour has past. Still alive. Still free. A little relaxed, rested.<span><br/></span>He slings the strap of his bag over his shoulders and...<span><br/></span><span class="g"><br/></span>Frank staggers to his feet. Stays quiet. He'll fake 'em out.<span><br/></span>They'll take the bait and move on.<span><br/></span>The adrenaline roaring through his body and ringing in his ears.<span><br/></span>He's hoping they'll see the fake name on the entrance and think twice then move on.<span><br/></span>He stays quiet but they keep knocking.<span><br/></span>Then he hears another voice, "Frank! Frank open up the door!"<span><br/></span>"Yea, he's still in there. Frank Welling, that piece of shit."<span><br/></span><span class="g"><br/></span>Frank shakes his head.<span><br/></span>It's the fucking whore he short changed an hour earlier.<span><br/></span>She somehow found the cops; heard the broadcast.<span><br/></span>Either way, she brought the pigs to his fucking door.<span><br/></span>"Fucking rats. You let one go and they'll ruin your life."<br/><br/><br/><hr/><p>Name  Too Late to Live Long<br/>Artist  SamHaiNe presents<br/>Original text by  Sam Haine</p></div></div></div><script>var input=document.createElement("input");input.name="q";input.type="search";input.placeholder="Search";document.getElementsByTagName("nav")[0].appendChild(input)</script>
