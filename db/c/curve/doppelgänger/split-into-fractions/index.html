I can't take much more from you.
I can't 'cause I don't want to.

Spiteful,
But a fact of life.
Not everyone you meet is that nice
When you scratch below the surface.

The characters have emerged and take pictures
That split into fractions in front of your eyes

I'm so bitchin', love to be it
My friends and I just love to meet
We meet all the time 'cause we think we're clever
So surreal, it makes us feel better
We think we're so... clever

I'm a swooning bitch and I love to be it
My friends and I just love to me-me-meet all the time
'Cause we think we're clever.
So surreal,
He makes us feel better.
We think we're so... clever.

The characters have emerged and take pictures
That split into fractions in front of your eyes.
(In front of our eyes)

There is nothing to behold

(In front of their eyes)

You can't be sure what you're dealing with
And that's got to be good for you.

I'd die on the cross before I crossed you.
You know I'd never hurt you,
I'm just not that type of girl.

Die on the cross before I cross you
Know I'd never hurt you
Just not that type,
I'm just not that type of girl
