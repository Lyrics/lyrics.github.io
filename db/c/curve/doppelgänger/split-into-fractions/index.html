<title>Curve – Split Into Fractions | Lyrics</title>
<meta name="description" content="Yeah / I can't take much more from you. / I can't 'cause I don't want to. / Spiteful, / But a fact of life. / Not everyone you meet is that nice / When you scratch below the surface. / The characters have emerged and take pictures / That split into fractions in front of your eyes / I'm so bitchin', love to be it / My friends and I just love to meet / We meet all the time 'cause we think we're clever / So surreal, it makes us feel better / We think we're so... clever / I'm a swooning bitch and I love to be it / My friends and I just love to me-me-meet all the time / 'Cause we think we're clever. / So surreal, / He makes us feel better. / We think we're so... clever. / The characters have emerged and take pictures / That split into fractions in front of your eyes. / (In front of our eyes) / There is nothing to behold / (In front of their eyes) / You can't be sure what you're dealing with / And that's got to be good for you. / I'd die on the cross before I crossed you. / You know I'd never hurt you, / I'm just not that type of girl. / Die on the cross before I cross you / Know I'd never hurt you / Just not that type, / I'm just not that type of girl / __________________________ / Name Split Into Fractions / Artist Curve / Album Doppelgänger / Original text by Toni Halliday, Dean Garcia"/>
