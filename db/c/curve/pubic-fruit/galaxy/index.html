He's got sugar on his lips (aah)
And he knows that the sickness is his (aah)
And he shows it (aah)
He just shows it (aah, aah)

He'll give you the remedy without the chemical,
Show you the picture without the scenery.
(aah, aah, aah, aah)

All he wants is
A blow by blow by blow account
Always searching for the real thing
Scratching the surface, getting nowhere.

My place has been stolen,
Invaded by sharks
Covered in glitter
As shiny as glass.

The pavement is soft and sweet
The galaxy is so elite

It won't say no
And it won't say yes
It won't say no
And it won't say yes

(aah)
(aah)

Crush me with your ice pick, I am the queen
I've come to take the sweetness and keep you down in my cave
(Keep you down in my cave)

The pavement is soft and sweet
The galaxy is so elite

It won't say no
And it won't say yes
It won't say no
And it won't say yes

It won't say no
Everybody knows
And it won't say yes
I see it in your eyes

It won't say no
Everybody knows
And it won't say yes
I see it in your eyes
