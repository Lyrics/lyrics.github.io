    <div class="view"><pre>It's nice to know It's nice to know,
Exactly where you're going.
It's nice to know It's nice to know,
Exactly where you're going.

Sorry for these bitter words,
But I'm in no mood to pretend,
Why should I bother with you,
When you're not even a good friend.

I'm the tosser for thinking,
It was anything more than it was,
But you're the loser,
Yes you're the loser,
You think you're above god
And beyond reach,
Beyond reach,
Beyond reach,
Beyond reach.

It's nice to know,
It's nice to know,
Exactly where you're going.

Never pick a fight with someone bigger than you,
That's what I learnt when I was at school.
And it doesn't really matter
How clever you think you are.
Those years, they leave
All kinds of scars.

It's nice to know, nice to know
Exactly where you're going.
It's nice to know, nice to know
Exactly where you're going.

Carry on as you always have,
And you will get,
Your just reward.
It may not be what you expected,
But then there's nothing
You can't afford.

Oh I'm the joker for dreaming,
That it could get much worse than this.
But you're the loser,
Yes you're the loser,
You think you're above god
And beyond reach,
Beyond reach,
Beyond reach,
Beyond reach.</pre></div>
