You find yourself in the middle of a storm
You thought you were hard
But you've barely been formed

See who you are
As your future is faced
It's not that far
No step is retraced

Today you're safe
Tomorrow who knows
Guarantees are fool's gold
34 turns to 43
See my mistakes
Don't become me

You find yourself in the middle of a storm
You thought you were hard
But you've barely been formed

See who you are
As your future is faced
It's not that far
No step is retraced

Today you're safe
Tomorrow who knows
Guarantees are fool's gold
34 turns to 43
See my mistakes
Don't become me
