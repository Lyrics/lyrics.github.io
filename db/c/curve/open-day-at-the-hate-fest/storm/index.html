<title>Curve â€“ Storm | Lyrics</title>
<meta name="description" content="You find yourself in the middle of a storm / You thought you were hard / But you've barely been formed / See who you are / As your future is faced / It's not that far / No step is retraced / Today you're safe / Tomorrow who knows / Guarantees are fool's gold / 34 turns to 43 / See my mistakes / Don't become me / You find yourself in the middle of a storm / You thought you were hard / But you've barely been formed / See who you are / As your future is faced / It's not that far / No step is retraced / Today you're safe / Tomorrow who knows / Guarantees are fool's gold / 34 turns to 43 / See my mistakes / Don't become me / ___________ / Name Storm / Artist Curve / Album Open Day at The Hate Fest / Original text by Toni Halliday"/>
