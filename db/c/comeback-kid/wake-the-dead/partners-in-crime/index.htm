<div><pre>I did this to myself
The summer air burning in my lungs
One more glance till I come undone
Let's stop this rising sun

Bright lights can see
They always shine right through me
Leaving me an open book
Of halfways and could-have-beens
Taking us to the end, end, end
And that summer changed us
It's best I admit that to myself
Stuck trapped in memories
The tragic tale of you and me

Can't get back to the way we were
Nothing else mattered
It was us against the world

Now it's just me sucking in that summer air
What a summer, I had no care
How quick it all crashed down
Not willing to bend, bend, bend

And these struggles changed us
It's best to admit that to yourself
Stuck trapped in memories
The tragic tale of you and me

Can't get back to the way we were
Nothing else mattered
It was us against the world

That morning came too soon
What were we suppose to do
One choice torn in two
I know what you were put through
And I thought we had it
We didn't have enough
We can't go back
We'll never go back now
THIS IS THE END</pre></div>
