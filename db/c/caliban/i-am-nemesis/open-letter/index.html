<title>Caliban â€“ Open Letter | Lyrics</title>
<meta name="description" content="Corporate cunts and pencil pushers / Prostitute your mind for cash / This way of live, it made me suffer / Trade your given time for trash / You all work jobs you badly hate / To keep the bills at pay / For shit you bought, but you don't need / What self-deceptive way / Right from the cradle / Straight to the grave / They want to tell us / How to behave / Right from the cradle / Straight to the end / They want to force us to pretend / An open letter to you all / Your greed will take it's toll / We're with our backs against the wall / But it's only built to fall / You tell me dreams are made to fail, / Like there is no escape / Prepared to walk / The longest trail / Away from mental rape. / Intimidate me with your lies / I'm paying any price / And when I come to say goodbye, / Can't look me in the eye / Right from the cradle / Straight to the grave / They want to tell us / How to behave / Right from the cradle / Straight to the end / They want to force us to pretend / An open letter to you all / Your greed will take it's toll / We're with our backs against the wall / But it's only built to fall / But I chose not to live like that / I'm fighting my way back! / An Open letter to you all / An Open letter to you all / Your greed will take it's toll / An Open letter to you all / It's only built to fall / An Open letter to you all / Your greed will take it's toll / We're with our backs against the wall / But it's only built to fall / Built to fall / _________________ / Name Open Letter / Artist Caliban / Album I Am Nemesis"/>
