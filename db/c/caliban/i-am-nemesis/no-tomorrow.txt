Write down a story I'd rather forget
Won't mend the heart that's shattered and shred
Lord knows we tried, lord knows we failed
Mistrustful feelings slowly prevailed

We fade and fade from kiss to kiss
With everything that lovely is
We've both grown cold from fight to fight
Until our love has died

All my dreams are far away
You took my life and gave me hell
Give me back my yesterday
Or should I finally bid farewell

Never give all the heart for love
No effort's ever good enough
Highs result in lowest lows,
We disavow 'til it clearly shows

A bad hand dealt, too blind with trust
Gave you my all, till all was lost
There ain't no rose without a thorn
Our love could grow and be reborn
And when you walk away
Then walk away my dear
But when you turn around
I wont be standing here

No tomorrow
No tomorrow

All my dreams are far away
You took my life and gave me hell
Give me back my yesterday
Or should I finally bid farewell

All my dreams are far away
You took my life and gave me hell
Give me back my yesterday
Or should I finally bid farewell

No love
No tomorrow
No tomorrow (No tomorrow)
