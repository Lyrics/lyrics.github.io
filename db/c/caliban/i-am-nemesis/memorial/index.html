<title>Caliban â€“ Memorial | Lyrics</title>
<meta name="description" content="This is a memorial / To honor the long gone / This is a burial / My heaven has gone wrong / Those times we had so long ago / Like yesterday, I miss 'em so much / I can't let go / My heart is full of hate / It's bleeding love / Father / I have to say goodbye / To keep my self alive / I can still see you / You're fading away but / I can still feel you / though you're drifting away from me (away from me) / You're drifting away / This is a memorial / To honor the long gone / This is a burial / My heaven has gone wrong / Are you still here, still in this place? / What's left behind, where is god's grace? / You broke my faith / My heart is full of hate / It's bleeding love / Father / I have to say goodbye / To keep my self alive / I can still see you / You're fading away but / I can still feel you / Though you're drifting away from me (away from me) / You're drifting away / My heart is aching / That's all I know / Hope is fading / I'll let you go / My heart is aching / That's all I know / Hope is fading / I'll let you go / This is a memorial / This is a burial / This is a memorial / This is a burial / I can still see you / You're fading away but / I can still feel you / Though you're drifting away from me (away from me) / You're drifting away / ______________ / Name Memorial / Artist Caliban / Album I Am Nemesis"/>
