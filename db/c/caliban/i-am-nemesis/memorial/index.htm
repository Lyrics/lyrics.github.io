<div><pre>This is a memorial
To honor the long gone
This is a burial
My heaven has gone wrong

Those times we had so long ago
Like yesterday, I miss 'em so much
I can't let go

My heart is full of hate
It's bleeding love
Father
I have to say goodbye
To keep my self alive

I can still see you
You're fading away but
I can still feel you
though you're drifting away from me (away from me)
You're drifting away

This is a memorial
To honor the long gone
This is a burial
My heaven has gone wrong

Are you still here, still in this place?
What's left behind, where is god's grace?
You broke my faith

My heart is full of hate
It's bleeding love
Father
I have to say goodbye
To keep my self alive

I can still see you
You're fading away but
I can still feel you
Though you're drifting away from me (away from me)
You're drifting away

My heart is aching
That's all I know
Hope is fading
I'll let you go

My heart is aching
That's all I know
Hope is fading
I'll let you go

This is a memorial
This is a burial

This is a memorial
This is a burial

I can still see you
You're fading away but
I can still feel you
Though you're drifting away from me (away from me)
You're drifting away</pre></div>
