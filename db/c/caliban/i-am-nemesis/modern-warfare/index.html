<title>Caliban â€“ Modern Warfare | Lyrics</title>
<meta name="description" content="Welcome to war / Everybody knows you and everybody told you / That nobody needs you and nobody cares / Everybody / Is at war with their fingers on the board / What's real and in your head / You release your poison to the world / This is the modern plague / Welcome to war / You can't escape / If this is real, I'd rather go blind / Than have this world pulled over my eyes / Cause in the end, it's all in my mind / And you're the one who's left behind / Everybody knows you and everybody told you / That nobody needs you and nobody cares / Everybody / Is caught in a world of make believe / Get a life - this is not real / We allow ourselves to be deceived / A virus, no one could heal / Welcome to war / You can't escape / If this is real, I'd rather go blind / Than have this world pulled over my eyes / Cause in the end, it's all in my mind / And you're the one who's left behind / If this is real / If this is real / Welcome to war / You can't escape / If this is real, I'd rather go blind / Than have this world pulled over my eyes / Cause in the end, it's all in my mind / And you're the one who's left behind / FYI / I don't care if you fucking die / FYI / I don't care if you fucking die / ____________________ / Name Modern Warfare / Artist Caliban / Album I Am Nemesis"/>
