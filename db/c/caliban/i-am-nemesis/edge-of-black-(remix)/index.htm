<div><pre>Black gold, black gold
Our soul's been sold (sold)
It drips down our throats
Fills up our lungs
We can barely breathe
Can't spread our wings

Golden horizon
Burst in flames
Burning despair
Again and again
Golden horizon
So bright, but it's fading
Burst in flames
Eternal return
We're waiting and waiting
Again and again and again

We know
But we'll never change
It's true
That's what we became
We're standing on the edge
We'll never change
We'll never change

We know
But we'll never change
It's true
That's what we became
We're standing on the edge
We'll never change
We'll never change
Edge of black
Edge of black

Like a king with a rusty crown
Like a saint on its way down
To the deepest ocean floor
Forevermore!

Black gold, black gold (gold)
Our soul's been sold (sold)
We all know the truth
But we'll never change
A shadow of a saint
That's what we became

Golden horizon
So bright, but it's fading
Burst in flames
Eternal return
We're waiting and waiting
Again and again and again

We know
But we'll never change
It's true
That's what we became
We're standing on the edge
We'll never change
We'll never change

We know
But we'll never change
It's true
That's what we became
We're standing on the edge
We'll never change
We'll never change
Edge of black
Edge of black

The destroying angel shall arise
To give salvation to a world of lies
We will drown in an ocean of black
And we all deserve it
No way back!

The destroying angel shall arise
To give salvation to a world of lies
We will drown in an ocean of black
And we all deserve it
No way back!

The destroying angel shall arise
To give salvation to a world of lies
We will drown in an ocean of black
And we all deserve it
No way back!

We know
But we'll never change
It's true
That's what we became
We're standing on the edge
We'll never change
We'll never change

We know
But we'll never change
It's true
That's what we became
We're standing on the edge
We'll never change
We'll never change
Edge of black
Edge of black
Edge of black</pre></div>
