I have no energy to be,
Where is my will and drive to be happy?
You are giving me hope,
But everything seems to be illusion and smoke
For love
For life
For surrender!

Just one word and I will be yours
Just one word and I'll burn again

Just one word for a new time
Cause in your eyes
I see my self,
I'm sick of running away

But in your eyes what do I mean?
A name, one among of thousend others?
Nasty and sweet are my thoughts
But my desire can't be satisfied
For love (for love)
For life (for life)
For surrender! (for surrender)

The worst shall be over now,
Your mental beautyness was stunning,
My feeling for myself
Is overgrown of dried plants
And I am sick
And I am sick
And I am sick
I am sick
And I am sick of running away!
I am sick
Sick of running away!

Just one word
Just one word for a new time
Cause in your eyes
I see my self,
I'm sick of running away

Just one word and I will be yours
Just one word and I'll burn again
