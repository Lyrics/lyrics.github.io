Waiting to breath out,
I saved my last breath to blow this darkness away,
Sweet shadows are calling me
My heart feels free to beat,
It's all about you,
My fiction beauty,
You are the one who could save me!

Save me, you were the avenger,
A shining illusion of my lust,
A shining illusion of my trust!

Sweet shadows are calling me,
my heart is scared to beat,
It's all about my fiction beauty,
You are the one who could kill me.

Save me, you were the avenger,
a shining illusion of my lust,
a shining illusion of my trust!

Sweet shadows are calling me,
My heart feels to weak too beat,
It's all about you my fiction beauty,
You are the one who killed me.

Save me, you were the avenger,
A shining illusion of my lust,
A shining illusion of my trust!

Waiting to breathe out, I saved my last breath to blow this darkness away.
