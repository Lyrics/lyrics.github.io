Now I'm standing here alone at the end of the road,
Screaming into the emptiness.
Why did we start this way together.
(Although) it was clear to me I would end up all alone,
(completely) broken and misused by love!?

I rape myself and I don't know why,
This whole thing makes no sense at all!

Have you ever understood me,
Have you ever felt the same,
Have you ever looked in my eyes,
Burt my starving heart.

I rape myself and I don't know why,
This whole thing makes no sense at all!

My heart was a present, but you didn't understand.
You weren't ready to go until the end together (beside me)
That is why I'm standing here all alone.
Screaming into the emptiness

I rape myself and I don't know why,
This whole thing makes no sense at all!
