Am I alive? I hear them coming - hear them running
Scratching at my door
Am I alive? Silence - darkness - sweat of fear
I could cry a million tears

This is it - the end of everything
The world bleeds from within
This is it - the apocalypse
We're ruled by wolves and rats
This is it - the end of everything
The world bleeds from within
This it ... this now - my apcalypse

Is this the end? I saw my blood - I closed my eyes
I woke up and realized
This is the end! Pitch black - dark red
"This world is dead"

This is it - the end of everything
The world bleeds from within
This is it - the apocalypse
We're ruled by wolves and rats
This is it - the end of everything
The world bleeds from within
This it ... this now - my apcalypse

Is this is the end? - This is the end!
I am alive! - The world is dead, but I am alive!
I will survive! - I will fight, but will I survive?

This is it - the end of everything
The world bleeds from within
This is it - the apocalypse
We're ruled by wolves and rats
This is it - the end of everything
The world bleeds from within
This it ... this is now - my apocalypse
