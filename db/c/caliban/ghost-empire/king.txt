Bow down and hail to the king!
I don't care what people think
Bow down with the face in the mud
I'm larger than life, I don't give a fuck

The throne is mine,
The crown fits fine
I couldn't care less about your crying
My rug is red,
Golden my bed
I have everything but regrets

Nothing to hold on
King of kingdom gone
I'm all alone

Bow down and hail to the king!
I don't give a fuck about anything!

I live among gods, I dine in hell
I'm on top of the world and I never fail
But within my towering walls
I sing a song about an empty soul

Nothing to hold on
King of kingdom gone
I'm all alone

Where I walk
There's light
Where I speak
There's quiet
Darkness inside
Silence cries
Is this what I long to be!?

Who have I become?
A king of kingdom gone
I'm trying to hold on

Nothing to hold on
King of kingdom gone
I'm all alone
I'm all alone
I'm all alone
