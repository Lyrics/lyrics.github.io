I'm far away from home,
I travel the world from town to town
And even when I feel alone,
Every stage feels like I'm coming home

A tribute to the faithful, you were always true!
A tribute to all kindred souls - here's to you!

This is your song - this is our song
We're coming home - where we belong
This is your song - this is our song
We're flesh and bone, so sing along...

You're not just a face in the crowd,
You're motivation, you're gold
Four words from a thousand lips,
WE ARE THE APOCALYPSE!!!

A tribute to the faithful, you were always true!
A tribute to all kindred souls - here's to you!

This is your song - this is our song
We're coming home - where we belong
This is your song - this is our song
We're flesh and bone, so sing along
Wohoo - straight from my heart
Wohoo - here's to you!!!

I promise you here and now,
As long as I breathe - I won't let you down.
I promise you here and now,
With my heart and soul, we'll never bow down - let's go!

This is your song - this is our song
We're coming home - where we belong
This is your song - this is our song
We're flesh and bone, so sing along
Wohoo - straight from my heart
Wohoo - here's to you!!!
