Father - forgive me - for I have sinned
I am - the walking dead - it's the end
Walk with me - epiphany

Fuck you! You let me down!
I am ghost - I am the walking dead!

I'm floating in a lifeless haze
My memories are slipping away

I don't - believe in God - anymore
My sky - is falling down - darkness falls
Walk with me - in agony

Fuck you! You let me down!
I am ghost - I am the walking dead!

I'm floating in a lifeless haze
My memories are slipping away
I'm floating away...

I'am ghost!!!
