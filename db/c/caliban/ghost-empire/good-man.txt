As I lay here - reflecting my life
I'm all alone, after all I've said and done.

Do you remember - all the times you cried in vain?
Do you remember - all the times I let you down?
Do you remember - all the times I could not ease the pain?
Do you remember - all the times I let you down?

I don't see me being a good man, no one is here to say goodbye
I wish I could go back to my broken past
I'm a broken man with nothing left
I know you can't forgive - I wish you could forget!

Do you remember - all the moments that I missed?
Do you remember - all the times I could be loved and kissed?
Do you remember - all treasures I threw away?
Do you remember - when I fled and should have stayed?

I don't see me being a good man, no one is here to say goodbye
I wish I could go back to my broken past
I'm a broken man with nothing left
I know you can't forgive - I wish you could forget!

So here I am at the end of the road,
I walk alone and nobody gives a fuck!!! FUCK!!!

I wish I could go back to my broken past
I'm a broken man with nothing left
I know you can't forgive - I wish you could forget!

As I lay here - reflecting my life
I'm all alone, after all I've said and done.
