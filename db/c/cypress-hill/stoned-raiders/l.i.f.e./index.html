Once again
We're back
It's the big bad Cypress Hill
You know what time it is

(Beat fades in)
Whoop
Whoop
Whoop
Whoop
Whoop
Legalize it,
Cypress Hill will advertise it
Legalize it, (Yeah, Yeah, Yeah)
Cypress Hill advertise it
advertise it, advertise it

(Chorus: B Real and Sen Dog)
Once Upon,
(B-Real singing)
Bugaboo L.I.F.E (Now Here it is )
Why, Why, Why (Bo Bo Bo Bo)
Cypress is still here
We're of those glad MCees
Still Puffin Weed, Weed
Why Diddely Why
Why, Why, Why

(B Real)
Never fucked like this
But I smoke blunts like this
People ask: Why you pull stunts like this?
Cuz I believe in doing what I got' a
A lot' a people don't understand nada
The Mic burns
You was at
It turn's to a slaughter
You wanna think about chilling the fuck out,
You all gonna Top Allah, Pop collar,
Niggas, Latin Thungs
All my family love barillas
Beginners get pushed to back of the pack
Invented and lend out, without not a tech
You're on the top of the game
But you work on a name till one day
To put us in the walk of fame
Don't call a name to recall the fame
Eventually Dru is in the Hall of Fame
You know what the deal is,
You know what the heal is,
You know who the Real is,
You know what my skill is,

(Chorus: B Real and Sen Dog)
(Humming, Sen Dog: Sighing)

(Sen Dog)
I get mental
This ain't no pad and a pencil
chrome microphone,
My only utincel
Attack the track, like I got nothing to lose (That's right)
I test myself, just to shut up and proove
That the C-Y-P-R-E-S-S
Got you funky, while I'm real deaf
Put it to the test, and you will confess
Soul Assassins is the best
Check it homeboy, got to spot cracking (crackin)
Six LP, from that Thugged-out Latin
Turn the heat up, and keep it hot
Always give ya mo', and then thank
We got to freak the Hip Hop and the hot ride
I'm on to make shows and can't hide
Had first 'self titled', became an Idol
*Spanish* in a Sub town barrio

(Chorus: B Real and Sen Dog)

(Sen Dog)
Now Here it is
Bo Bo Bo Bo</div></div>
