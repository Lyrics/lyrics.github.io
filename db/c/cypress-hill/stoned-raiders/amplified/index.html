I be that, short-temper, hostile rhyme bringer
Lifestyle gone wild, similar to rock singers
Check me on the big screen, livin' out my dreams
Cypress, Assassins, SX, latin thug thing
Fools think they get bad, I ain't really with that
Flavour of the month, bro, (?) try to dispatch
Always got the good badge, take it to the head
Got me wasted like Jerry from the Grateful Dead
Don't trip, get a grip, be strong and don't fake it
Or else you get beat down, an' stripped butt-naked
I just kick the lyric, straight from the spirit
You can tell I got soul first time as you hear it

Welcome to the show, all come inside
You can hear proper sound when it's Amplified
You wanna party with the best and say "fuck the rest"
'Cos we take away ya stress and never settle for less

Welcome to the show, all come inside
You can hear proper sound when it's Amplified
You wanna party with the best and say "fuck the rest"
'Cos we take away ya stress and never settle for less

When you deal with the Hill, keep your mouth still
If you rely on your skill then rely on your steel
If you have no ideal, or any thoughts to feel
What you sought was real, to give 'em slots to fill
Busters stop to deal
But I face them, quicker than takin' a box of pills
Now you gots to chill
Get cops and sheilds, steady, hark the (?)
If they're lookin' for prey, ready to stalk and kill
As I lock the wheel, don't you mock the drill
'Cos I'll cock my steel, make you drop and spill
Got no mercy unless you talk to deal
Quit talk and kneel, you won't top my will, bitch!

Welcome to the show, all come inside
You can hear proper sound when it's Amplified
You wanna party with the best and say "fuck the rest"
'Cos we take away ya stress and never settle for less

Welcome to the show, all come inside
You can hear proper sound when it's Amplified
You wanna party with the best and say "fuck the rest"
'Cos we take away ya stress and never settle for less

Say what?

Ain't no-body better, on that you can bet (CY-PRESS!)
Wanna see a dope show? Put your money on my set
Real emcees and real DJs
Real South-siders from the heart of LA
Now, back in the day we had big sucess
And it's like that now and we won't settle for less
You can beat the LB from the new latin lingo
Nowadays you nothin', without a hit single
Time to get loco, and put bodies in motion
Hit the stage in a rage, and start up a commotion
No I ain't jokin, see my mic smokin'?
I slam it like the art and make sure it's broken

Welcome to the show, all come inside
You can hear proper sound when it's Amplified
You wanna party with the best and say "fuck the rest"
'Cos we take away ya stress and never settle for less

Welcome to the show, all come inside
You can hear proper sound when it's Amplified
You wanna party with the best and say "fuck the rest"
'Cos we take away ya stress and never settle for less</div></div>
