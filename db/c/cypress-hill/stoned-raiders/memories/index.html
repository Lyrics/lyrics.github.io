<title>Cypress Hill â€“ Memories | Lyrics</title>
<meta name="description" content="As I sit in my silver stack thinking about way back / Even before I started blazing the chronic sack / I was a go wild unfocused troublesome kid / Looking up to all the gangsters and the shit they did / I was at unimpressionable age through a faze / An unmentionable stage deranged full of rage / Walking through life in a haze with dark clouds / Hanging over my head being wicked and loud / And sometimes those demons haunt me and taunt me / Follow me pursue me confuse me they want me / They come at me from all angles and dangles / Memories in front of me, but I wont run away / I put the gun away but sometimes my hand ditches / But I don't want to get locked away cause I whack bitches / I left those ways back in the old days / So go away I don't got no time to throw away / Memories they haunt me (they haunt me) they follow me / To the day I die (we fight and we struggle out here so we can stay alive) / Memories they haunt me (they haunt me) they follow me / To the day I die (got to do what I got to do out her so I can survive) / I got my education on the streets / And I learned how to spit rhymes out with or without beats / To say whatever I went through or going through / Tripping off people who acting like they been knowin you / Learn how some of these record companies be holdin you / Attaching an image in the end controllin you / But we set out to set ourselves apart / And let these people know just what they had from the start / It's like Ghostface said we studied our art form / We turned the mike on and spit a fucking dark storm / People slept on me and doubted my skill level / But I'm tenacious and I got a strong will level / You been introduced to some of the real rebels / Injected with venom from god to kill devils / Memories they haunt me (they haunt me) they follow me / To the day I die (we fight and we struggle out here so we can stay alive) / Memories they haunt me (they haunt me) they follow me / To the day I die (got to do what I got to do out her so I can survive) / Memories they haunt me (they haunt me) they follow me / To the day I die (we fight and we struggle out here so we can stay alive) / Memories they haunt me (they haunt me) they follow me / To the day I die (got to do what I got to do out her so I can survive) / I remember my days as youth / Teenage gangsters with somethin to prove / See man amuse and we creep and we strew / Catch your ass slipping and dump on their crew / Just -- having fun but you crazy kids / Never thought about no prison beds / Got gang-sters twenty-five and alive / Never see the kids all fucking wild / But that's the game and shit don't change / Get respect for smoking brains / You get a name and you build your rep / You courting fools coming in your set / Before you know we're having fun / Slamming doping and packing gun / Leaving mad traces and blasting their faces / Got a hundred years for all my fucking cases / Memories they haunt me (they haunt me) they follow me / To the day I die (we fight and we struggle out here so we can stay alive) / Memories they haunt me (they haunt me) they follow me / To the day I die (got to do what I got to do out here so I can survive) / Memories they haunt me (they haunt me) they follow me / To the day I die (we fight and we struggle out here so we can stay alive) / Memories they haunt me (they haunt me) they follow me / To the day I die (got to do what I got to do out here so we can survive) / ______________ / Name Memories / Artist Cypress Hill / Album Stoned Raiders"/>
