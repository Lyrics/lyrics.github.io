<title>Cypress Hill â€“ Get It Anyway | Lyrics</title>
<meta name="description" content="I'mma do my thing, let me tell you right now / Cuz I don't know any other way of livin' my life now / Some of you know the struggle, some of you live in a bubble / Some of you hustle and some of you just lookin' for trouble / (some of you just lookin' for trouble!) / I don't follow or lead, tomorrow's a dream / Pray to God to intervine on all the sorrow I've seen (U Know I mean?) / You want out of here, you can leave when you wanna / Nothin' can stop you if that's your type of persona (Persona!) / Life is short enough don't make me say it 10 times (10Times!) / I'll kick over for mine even in the end times (Times) / I can beat the system, come on, let's say it with me / Show me some optimism, we can take over the city (We can take over the city!) / Real life represent the scams since the first day / Gangstas, hustlas, grindin' out around the way / Can't stop gotta be always on the paper chase / Educated, they won't give it, but I did it anyway / (I get it anyway) / Regardless what the haters say / I'mma get it anyway / I'mma get it anyway / (I get it anyway) / Regardless what the haters say / I'mma get it anyway / I'mma get it anyway / There comes a time in your life, you gotta go for yours / Stay invaders like the battle of forever more / I stay pedal to the metal foot on the floor / I'mma keep on the streets, knockin' down your doors / I'm by the dollar, like everybody oughtta be / Don't burn nobody and make the money honestly / Open your home with the internet technology / I get it anyway just by the economy / See I ain't coughin' unless it makes a profit / I'm droppin' it so hot, chick, like everyday gossip / Regardless of the climate, I'm gonna get it every day / Even if the bullets spray, I'm gonna get it anyway / This is for my real life represent the scams since the first day / Gangstas, hustlas, grindin' out around the way / Can't stop, gotta be always on the paper chase / Educated, they won't give it but I did it anyway / (I get it anyway) / Regardless what the haters say / I'mma get it anyway / I'mma get it anyway / (I get it anyway) / Regardless what the haters say / I'mma get it anyway / I'mma get it anyway / Sing / (La, la, la, la, la) / You know we blazin' up that / (La, la, la, la, la) / All around the world / (La, la, la, la, la) / Our peoples gettin' money / (La, la, la, la, la) / Let me hear you sing / So let 'em hear the cellar by, the collar / Makin' it harder for you to wanna make an honest dollar / You wanna sip a little to make your pain numb / Tippin' that bottle got you forgettin' where you came from (Forgettin' where you came from!) / But I'm the same one, where you think my name's from? / I'mma keep it movin' and never stop till the game's done (Never stop till the game's done!) / Forever we live it, forever we spit it, remember the minute / You witnessed the realest that ever did it (Quit it!) / Still I'm committed, no matter what I hear from the critic / People can see through a gimmick, I'm puttin' on a clinic (I'm puttin' on a clinic!) / We a troubled times, swervin' through the double lines / You're in a head on collision 'cause now you servin' time (Now you servin' time!) / This is for my real life represent the scams since the first day / Gangstas, hustlas, grindin' out around the way / Can't stop gotta be always on the paper chase / Educated, they won't give it (Come on!), but I did it anyway / (I get it anyway) / Regardless what the haters say / Imma get it anyway / Imma get it anyway / (I get it anyway) / Regardless what the haters say / Imma get it anyway / Imma get it anyway / Sing! / (La la la la la) / You know we blazin' up that / (La la la la la) / All around the world / (La la la la la) / Our peoples getting money / (La la la la la) / Let me hear you sing! / (La la la la la) / You know we blazin' up that / (La la la la la) / All around the world / (La la la la la) / Our peoples getting money / (La la la la la) / Let me hear you sing! / (La la la la la) / You know we blazin' up that / (La la la la la) / All around the world / (La la la la la) / Our peoples getting money / (La la la la la) / ___________________ / Name Get It Anyway / Artist Cypress Hill / Album Rise Up"/>
