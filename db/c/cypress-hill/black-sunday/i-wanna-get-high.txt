I want to get high, so high.
I want to get high, so high.
I want to get high, so high.
I want to get high, so high.

Well that's the funk elastic,
The blunt I twist it,
The slammified,
Buddhafied,
Funk on your diskus.
Oh what you missed this?
You got to bear witness.
Catch a ho, and another ho,
Merry Christmas.
Yes I smoke shit,
Straight off the roach clip,
I roach it.
Fold the blunt at once,
To approach it.
Forward motion,
Make you sway like the ocean.
The herb is more
than just a powerful potion.
What's the commotion?
Yo,
I'm not joking around,
people learnin'
bout what they're smoking.
My oven's on high when I roast the quayle.
Tell Bill Clinton to go and inhale.
Exhale.
Now you the phunk of the Thai'
When I feel the effects

I want to get high, so high.
I want to get high, so high.
I want to get high, so high.
I want to get high, so high.
