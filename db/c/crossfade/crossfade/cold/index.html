    <div class="view"><pre>Looking back at me I see
That I never really got it right
I never stopped to think of you
I'm always wrapped up in
Things I cannot win
You are the antidote that gets me by
Something strong
Like a drug that gets me high

What I really meant to say
Is I'm sorry for the way I am
(I never meant to be so cold)
(Never meant to be so cold)

What I really meant to say
Is I'm sorry for the way I am
(I never meant to be so cold)
(Never meant to be so cold)

To you I'm sorry about all the lies
Maybe in a different light
You could see me stand on my own again
'Cause now i can see
You were the antidote that got me by
Something strong like a drug that got me high

What I really meant to say
Is I'm sorry for the way I am
(I never meant to be so cold)
(Never meant to be so cold)

What I really meant to say
Is I'm sorry for the way I am
(I never meant to be so cold)
(Never meant to be so cold)

(Never meant to be so cold...)

I never really wanted you to see
The screwed up side of me that I keep
Locked inside of me so deep
It always seems to get to me
I never really wanted you to go
So many things you should have known
I guess for me there's just no hope
I never meant to be so cold

What I really meant to say
Is I'm sorry for the way (is I'm sorry for the way) I am
(I never meant to be so cold)
(Never meant to be so cold)

What I really meant to say
Is I'm sorry for the way (is I'm sorry for the way) I am
(I never meant to be so cold)
(Never meant to be so cold)</pre></div>
