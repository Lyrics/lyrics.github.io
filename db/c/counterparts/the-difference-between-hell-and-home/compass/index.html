<title>Counterparts â€“ Compass | Lyrics</title>
<meta name="description" content="The weight came and went and took my will to live. / Spoiled by defeat, forced to drown in what's left of me. / That's when breathing became routine, and I could feel myself fading. / Stranded. / No direction, I am a compass. / Constantly spinning. / Constantly searching for the end. / Never reaching our destination. / But the goal was never when, or where, or who...; It was only you. / I appeared in your arms as if I had been born there. / You promised you'd never let me go. / But I don't know what to believe anymore. / Affection allowed me to let the light in, the fear made me whole again. / Help me rebuild my broken bones. / Help me regain my sanity. / But with caution always present, our pasts manifest themselves. / And we act as if this is what we deserve. / But I refuse to fail again. / I'd force my ghost to write your name in the flowers on my grave. / I watched the world give up on me. / I used to spend my nights praying for air in my bloodstream, now i long to feel your breath pass through my arteries. / The goal was never when, or where, or who...; It was only you. / I appeared in your arms as if I had been born there. / You promised you'd never let me go. / But I don't know what to believe anymore. / Fill me with your faith and let me leave. / I'm scratching at my skin to take my mind off the absence we've created. / The lines blur together like the veins in my arms. / And I wish I wasn't so alone, You are the difference between Hell and Home. / _____________ / Name Compass / Artist Counterparts / Album The Difference Between Hell and Home"/>
