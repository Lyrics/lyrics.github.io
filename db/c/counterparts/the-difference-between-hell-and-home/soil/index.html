<title>Counterparts â€“ Soil | Lyrics</title>
<meta name="description" content="Tragedy is all we have in common, and at times we allow it to swallow us whole. / Drawing the marrow from our misfortunes to ignite the fire that's inside, inhale the smoke from the burn that leaves you breathless. / Breathing life into the lifeless, dragging them into the sun and exposing them as apparitions. / But is there dignity in living as an entity? / "You could have made history, and we are already forgetting about you." / Humanity is poison, and we are lost without a cure. / So stop your heart and start the healing process. / I am not fit to walk among you, but I don't want to end my life. / And just know that If I knew of any common ground, I'd leave here now, and when I got there I would build a home that I could die in. / Just to say I tried to rest in peace. / Erase me from your memory. / The ones we love will let us down, and the rats will feed off of our failure. / Eventually, this is something that we must accept. / The world moves on without us. / We leave only footprints that fade away in time. / We leave our spirits to retrace our steps. / Walk with fire, and save yourself from vagrancy. / You are your memorial, find your mark and make it. / The soil is the last thing we ingest, we watch our ashes scatter. / You are your memorial, find your mark and make it. / __________ / Name Soil / Artist Counterparts / Album The Difference Between Hell and Home"/>
