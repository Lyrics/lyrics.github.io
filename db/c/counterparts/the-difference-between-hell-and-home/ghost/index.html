    <div class="view"><article id="lyrics"><p>Born of two; raised by four.<br/>I guess I took it all for granted, and only three remain.<br/>Even though you're wounded, I know that you're still here.<br/>I don't blame you, you just can't face the change.<br/>We spend our golden years as living ghosts.<br/>Caught in a constant state of purgatory.<br/>We are only burdened by our memories until the day they cease to exist, and we follow shortly after.<br/>Although I wonder if at any time, our minds fell upon the same plane.<br/>I know they did, I just wish I had a chance to go back and appreciate it.<br/>But we'll always have the winter, and the snow that got trapped behind the glass.<br/>You may be only a shell of the man that you used to be, but I love you just the same, and I will until the day you're gone.<br/>I just never know if I'm communicating with you or the disease.<br/>And even though I curse the idea of an afterlife, I still hope you're taken care of.<br/>You deserve to be at peace.<br/>Please don't forget my face.<br/>I won't forget to remember you.</p></article></div>
