I am more than familiar with feeling empty. The conduit; I allow myself to drain. My mind is the trench in which I will be buried. Watch me wither away. Put me out of my misery. I can only find solace in sleep, a sub-conscious sanctuary, I am longing to be set free. Yet I am the one who holds the key. I am the one who holds the key. A lifetime spent trying to place the blame on anyone or anything.
This is not who I am. I am not who I used to be. Set me free! x3
