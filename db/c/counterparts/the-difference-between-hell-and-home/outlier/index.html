<title>Counterparts â€“ Outlier | Lyrics</title>
<meta name="description" content="I live with the awareness of my own seclusion. / Existence fuelled by separation, A war I will not win. / Embracing only alienation. / To suffer is to abandon the only home I've ever had. Outlier. / I don't belong here. / The present state of existence acts as a refuge for the weak. / To shield our eyes is to blind mankind. Refusal to secede. / Inhabiting a world of filth which others have condemned. / We won't live our lives for them. Human hatred is my second nature. / This is the root of my isolation. I am what I am, and I am an outcast. / Don't look for me in the clouds, when I am beneath you. / Nowhere to be found. / Submerged in apathy, it's just becoming hard to care, and I am nothing. / I have grown sick of the sound of my heartbeat. / And while the whole world breathes in unison. / My lungs are my shield, to reject the world around me. / I am what I am, and I am an outcast. / _____________ / Name Outlier / Artist Counterparts / Album The Difference Between Hell and Home"/>
