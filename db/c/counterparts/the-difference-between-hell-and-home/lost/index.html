    <div class="view"><pre>As far back as I can remember, the failure was always there.
It was the only real companion that I have ever had.
Not meant to live like this.
Consciousness is nothing more than a vicious cycle, and I am being bled dry by my conviction.
I've spent my life trying to find my confidence, and found absolutely nothing.
Life is a lost cause.
Too weak to carry on.
I wish I'd never met who I once was.
Not meant to live like this.
Pursuing the love in all that I have lost, but I have left myself neglected, deserted from the start.
Longing for a chance to wander; a chance to chase my aspiration.
When you're devoid of feeling, you just do as your told.
Hatred is exhausting, but it's all I'll ever know.</pre></div>
