One by one, I watched them leave me behind like living debris.<br/>Fortunately, I know that I'm not worth it.<br/>Because in my purest form, I was never good enough for anyone.<br/>Why did I think that this time it'd be different?<br/>I came bearing only the beat of my heart and the best of my intentions.<br/>I tried by hardest but I couldn't make you feel a fucking thing.</p></article></div>
