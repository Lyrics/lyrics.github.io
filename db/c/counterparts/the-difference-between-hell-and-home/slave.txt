If I allow the light to leave my eyes, I will never see again. The thoughts disintegrate into cognitive pollution. Abandoning my body, renouncing my existence. Show me the meaning of happiness. Trapped inside this nightmare, but I haven't slept for days. I am a slave, a slave to what I cannot see. Are we being strung along or are we just strung out? The quest to be clairvoyant: You are your own black hole. How much longer do I really have when I wish every breath would be my last? Your words like rope, tied around my throat. Remove the earth beneath me. Watch my spirit sink.
