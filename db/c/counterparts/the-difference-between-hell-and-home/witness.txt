Expose me for all that I am. The man behind the masquerade, I am my own false witness. Fact resides solely in the depths of my mind...; and will I ever really let it come to surface? You only see what I want you to see, and you believe all that you're told. Serenity is a beautiful hoax. A liar. I have the whole world convinced of my contentment. No truth in this. I've lost count of all the times I made it home alive...;and wished I hadn't. Expose me for all that I am. The man behind the masquerade, I am my phone false witness. I'm left to conquer the mountains in my mind, and I am my maker. Life is what's killing me. I hate the fact that I'm just fine. Forever seeking something to take responsibility. Life is what's killing me. I hate the fact that I'm alive. Forever searching for my scapegoat because I refuse to face reality. At least I can say I tried, to cherish every single day where I woke up and didn't want to die. I'd work my hands down to the bone trying to stay suspended in those specific seconds. But I know I'd just be counting down the minutes until I'm miserable again.
