The best news I've ever heard was when you said you wouldn't leave
 Because I know the distance would tear us apart.
 And all the things you said,
 Wouldn't mean a thing if you weren't here with me.
 So as you turn your back to me,
 I just want to let you know that I could never do this to you.
 This is where our roads divide and they split in two,
 And I will never see you again.
 But I respect your choice.
 The familiar pain sets in again,
 But I can't let this drag me down.
 It's things like this that made me who I am today.
 It's thing like this that helped to shape/make me who I am today,
 It's every hardship that I've faced.
 And I've lost hope in myself,
 But I just want you to know:
 As everyday goes by,
 I must accept that you're now living your own life.
