<title>Counterparts â€“ Dark Ages | Lyrics</title>
<meta name="description" content="The sense of insignificance / It winds itself around your chest. / Surrender and submission have now become what it takes to be alive. / Just keep in mind this happens to the best of us at times, / And it's not going to get any easier. / You walk this road of desolation, / Only to end up on your knees, / But just know that you are not alone. / The only things holding you back are the lies that you refuse to challenge. / You're drowning in a sea of self destruction, / And your lungs are starting to cave in. / And when you feel that your words can only be heard in echoes, / They are more deafening than ever before. / Every day we face helps build the strength that makes us who we are. / I've lived through this, / And so can you. / Suffering in silence has become something thrown to our past. / And though the friendships that we've built are constantly falling apart, / The remaining few retain the most heart. / And I'll give you my heart. / _______________ / Name Dark Ages / Artist Counterparts / Album Prophets"/>
