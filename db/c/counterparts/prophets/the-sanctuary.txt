We are now rooted in the ground that we were born into
 And this is where we come from,
 Where we will remain.
 This place may have its' flaws,
 But I can always call the pavement we now stand upon 'my home'.
 This is our home.
 Through both the areas of wealth and poverty,
 I appreciate every inch of our city.
 And I don't know if I could ever leave.
 Our sanctuary,
 Our stomping ground,
 Our territory,
 Our fucking home.
 Love where you came from,
 This is your home.
 This is my home.
