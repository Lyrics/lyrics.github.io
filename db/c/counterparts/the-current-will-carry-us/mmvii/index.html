    <div class="view"><article id="lyrics"><p>Why do I need to justify my opinion, after all that I've seen and<br/>done? And year after year, we give our everything to get nothing in return. The<br/>time has come for things to change. We don't need your adoration, but we demand<br/>your respect. I will not allow anyone the opportunity to deny half a decade of<br/>labor. The places we've been, the faces we've seen, the months spent far from<br/>home. This is what moves us. This is what we've grown accustom to. What we will<br/>leave behind can not be measured in a dollar figure. There's a much deeper<br/>meaning than that. I can't wait until the day when we've surpassed everything<br/>that gave you a false sense of importance. I want you to question yourself. I<br/>want you to watch you slip away. I want you to realize that your existence has<br/>meant nothing. I hate you more than you could ever fucking know. And I hate<br/>you for making me feel like this. I know deep down that I'm a good person, but<br/>my patience is wearing thin. The best retaliation I can think of, would be to<br/>let you know that for once in my life, I'm truly happy. I'm more than content<br/>with who and where I am. Your oppression has had no effect. I don't need to<br/>justify my opinion after everything we've been through. And year after year, we<br/>give our everything and what we receive in return, I can't explain with words.<br/>I'm so fucking thankful that I made it to where I am today. (I watched the<br/>world upon your shoulders, and from these heights it's so far down.)</p></article></div>
