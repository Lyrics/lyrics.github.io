I never asked for anyone to listen, and I never asked for
 anyone to take my words to heart. I've let myself become a target based on
 nothing more than expression. I will not lie to others, and I won't lie to
 myself. If you're searching for safety you can find it somewhere else, and I
 won't mind. I've never seen myself as optimistic, so this should come as no
 surprise. No one feels good forever. Not even me. But this doesn't give us an
 excuse to allow ourselves to become useless like the rest. We will turn our
 hatred into something to be proud of. We will make life worth living.
