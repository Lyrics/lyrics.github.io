<title>Counterparts â€“ Jumping Ship | Lyrics</title>
<meta name="description" content="As time passes by / I feel everything changing but me / I will not feel the sting of defeat / I've watched days become months / become years / and I've lost all faith in progression / I will never allow myself to exchange all my morals for acceptance / If this is truly where I belong / I'll fucking be here until the end of time / I've watched everyone around me jump ship / and I hope they're left to sink / The current will carry us / I am proud of all that I've become / and I'm well aware that I have steered myself in the right direction / And life is your's to destroy / I just can't respect your decision / I would rather isolate myself than be a walking definition of travesty / I watched you do away with everything / I would love nothing more than to watch this world swallow you whole / You were the catalyst for your downfall / But where the rest have failed / we are bound to succeed / And mark my fucking words / as long as we are breathing / we will overcome / The integrity that we emanate day-to-day is unparalleled / and our efforts will not go unnoticed / We will be remembered / __________________ / Name Jumping Ship / Artist Counterparts / Album The Current Will Carry Us"/>
