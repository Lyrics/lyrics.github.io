Though I look forward to my future, just know I'm scared to
 death. After all is said and done, I won't have a clue what to do next. Will I
 struggle to find the answer? Will I take an easy way out? Or will I find the
 strength inside to carry on? My greatest fear is amounting to nothing. I
 fucking hate the fact that I feel no sense of security. But more importantly, I
 hate the fact that I can't confide in myself. It feels like nothing good will
 stay, unless I stay the same. I need to find a way to dissolve the uncertainty.
 This is who I am, and this is who I'll always be. I refuse to be afraid, of
 something I don't know to be true. I need to pick myself back up, I need to
 find a way to keep all the worry from head. Before it sends me to an early
 grave. I refuse to let fear define me.
