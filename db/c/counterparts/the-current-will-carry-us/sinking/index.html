<title>Counterparts – Sinking | Lyrics</title>
<meta name="description" content="This is the only thing I have worth holding onto / I have condensed my past to fit the lines on the pages that no one will ever see / But still I fight day after day 'cause this is all I've ever wanted my life to be / And I push everything I’ve ever loved away / To keep myself from sinking / To keep myself from sinking / To keep myself from sinking / If I find the bad in everything, / I can never be attached / I’m trying to find a balance / I’m trying to find a way / But every choice I’ve ever made brings me anywhere but home / But I’ve welcomed sacrifice with open arms / And I will never regret my decision / This is the only thing that makes me feel alive / Makes me feel alive / I’ve simply been searching for the right place to rest my head / I’m searching for common ground between all that I am and all that you need me to be / I’ve seen a future and want nothing to do with it / A constant campaign to impress those who never ever cared / I’m struggling but I won’t allow myself to sink / You know where to find me / I keep my composure and assume my place, in front of those who I love most / You’re the reason why we’re here / I’m struggling, but I won’t allow myself to sink / I’m struggling, but I won’t allow myself to sink / _____________ / Name Sinking / Artist Counterparts / Album The Current Will Carry Us"/>
