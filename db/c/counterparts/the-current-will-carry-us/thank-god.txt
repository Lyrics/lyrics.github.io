I want to thank you for never being there. Your absence has
 forced me to find my own way. While others are led through life with a
 blindfold, I can see clearly, the rain will wash me away. I reject the thought
 of a god when all we see is the work of an ill-fated world. I reject a liar's
 cross. Who am I to say what I believe is right for the masses? I just know it's
 right for me. For this I have secured my place in hell, but every day I face is
 my own heaven in the making. What do you believe in? What do you think is
 right? Centuries have passed, the voice of reason is still being suppressed.
 Salvation dances in front of their faces, but they're too blind to see. I
 reject the thought of a God, when all we see is the work of an ill-fated world.
 I reject a liar's cross. Thank you for never being there. Thank God for never
 being there.
