I'm looking back on those I once looked up to, and I can't help
 but feel that I'm looking down. Everyone I've ever admired has left me with
 nothing. Not even a memory. I remember growing up, and yearning to be just like
 you. It pains me to admit that I held you in such a high regard, as if my life
 would mean nothing without your approval. But now I see the error of my ways.
 All that time spent searching for myself in someone else. I think it's safe to
 say that I've become everything I wanted to be. And no one can take that from
 me. All of my heroes have failed me, but I won't ever fail myself. I can't
 believe how naive I used to be when I never really needed anyone. All of my
 heroes have failed me, but I won't ever fail myself.
