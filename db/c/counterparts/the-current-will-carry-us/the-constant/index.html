    <div class="view"><div id="lyrics">I will graciously accept that my life's work, whether it be
In the past, the present, or the future will be overshadowed by those around me
With a different definition of "success." Though I can't explain the path I've
Chosen, all I know is I'm right where I need to be. And though I've turned down
A chance at fame and fortune, I know that there is no greater payment than
This. And I'm so fucking far from the life I'm supposed to lead, and the man
I'm supposed to be and I couldn't be happier. And I will remain a constant, I
Know where I stand, and I refuse to let their selfishness take control of who I
Am. While I may die poor, at least my life had meaning, there's more to life
Than living, and I truly feel alive. And I know that when I die, there will be
Others who feel the same way ready to take my place. This is our song of
Protest. I promise you that nothing is slowing us down. While I may die poor,
At least my life had meaning, there's more to life than living and I truly feel
Alive. And I know that when I die, there will be others who feel the same way
Ready to take my place. I will laugh in the face of those who tell me
Different. Even with both of my feet planted firmly on the ground, I am free to
Move in my own direction. I will remain a constant. I know where I stand.</div></div>
