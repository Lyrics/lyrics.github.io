<title>Counterparts â€“ Pedestal | Lyrics</title>
<meta name="description" content="I'm looking back on those I once looked up to, and I can't help / but feel that I'm looking down. Everyone I've ever admired has left me with / nothing. Not even a memory. I remember growing up, and yearning to be just like / you. It pains me to admit that I held you in such a high regard, as if my life / would mean nothing without your approval. But now I see the error of my ways. / All that time spent searching for myself in someone else. I think it's safe to / say that I've become everything I wanted to be. And no one can take that from / me. All of my heroes have failed me, but I won't ever fail myself. I can't / believe how naive I used to be when I never really needed anyone. All of my / heroes have failed me, but I won't ever fail myself. / ______________ / Name Pedestal / Artist Counterparts / Album The Current Will Carry Us"/>
