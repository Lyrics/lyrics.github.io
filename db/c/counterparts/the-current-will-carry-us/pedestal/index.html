    <div class="view"><div id="lyrics">I'm looking back on those I once looked up to, and I can't help
but feel that I'm looking down. Everyone I've ever admired has left me with
nothing. Not even a memory. I remember growing up, and yearning to be just like
you. It pains me to admit that I held you in such a high regard, as if my life
would mean nothing without your approval. But now I see the error of my ways.
All that time spent searching for myself in someone else. I think it's safe to
say that I've become everything I wanted to be. And no one can take that from
me. All of my heroes have failed me, but I won't ever fail myself. I can't
believe how naive I used to be when I never really needed anyone. All of my
heroes have failed me, but I won't ever fail myself.</div></div>
