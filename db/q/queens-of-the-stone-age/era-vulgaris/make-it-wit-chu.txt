You wanna know if I know why?
I can't say that I do
Don't understand the evil eye
Or how one becomes two
I just can't recall what started it all
Or how to begin the end
I ain't here to break it
Just see how far it will bend
Again and again, again and again

I wanna make it
I wanna make it wit chu
Anytime, anywhere
I wanna make it (again and again)
I wanna make it wit chu

Sometimes the same is different
But mostly it's the same
These mysteries of life
That just ain't my thing
If I told you that I knew about the sun
And the moon I'd be untrue
The only thing I know for sure
Is what I wan' do
Anytime, anywhere

I wanna make it (again and again)
I wanna make it wit chu
Anytime, anywhere
I wanna make it (again and again)
I wanna make it wit chu
I wanna make it (anytime, anywhere)
I wanna make it wit chu (yeah)
I wanna make it
I wanna make it wit chu

I wanna make it (again and again)
I wanna make it wit chu
I wanna make it (anytime, anywhere)
I wanna make it wit chu
I wanna make it (again and again)
I wanna make it wit chu
I wanna make it (again and again and again and again and again)
