    <div class="view"><pre>Say, say my playmate
Won't you lay your hands on me?
Mirror my malady
Transfer my tragedy

Got a curse I cannot lift
Shines when the sunset shifts
When the moon is round and full
Gotta bust that box, gotta gut that fish

My mind's aflame
We could jet in a stolen car
But I bet we wouldn't get too far
Before the transformation takes
And blood lust tanks and crave gets slaked

My mind has changed
My body's frame, but God I like it
My heart's aflame
My body's strained but God I like it

My mind has changed
My body's frame, but God I like it
My heart's aflame
My body's strained but God I like it

Charge me your day rate
I'll turn you out in kind
When the moon is round and full
Gonna teach you tricks that will blow your Mongrel mind

Baby doll I recognize
You're a hideous thing inside
If ever there were a lucky kind it's
You, you, you, you

I know its strange, another way to get to know you
You'll never know unless we go, so let me show you
I know its strange, another way to get to know you
We've got to move, here comes the moon
So let it show you, show you now

Dream me, oh dreamer
Down to the floor
Open my hands and let them
Weave onto yours

Feel me, completer
Down to my core
Open my heart and let it
Bleed onto yours

Feeding on fever
Down on all fours
Show you what all the
Howlin's for

Hey, hey my playmate
Let me lay waste to thee
Burned down their hanging trees
It's hot (here), hot (here), hot (here), hot (here)

Got a curse we cannot lift (We're howling forever)
Shines when the sunshine shifts (We're howling forever)
There's a cure comes with a kiss
The bite that binds the gift that gives (We're howling forever)

Now that we got gone for good
Writhing under your riding hood (We're howling forever)
Tell your gra'ma and your mama too
It's true, true, true, true
(We're howling forever, oh oh)
(We're howling forever, oh oh)
(We're howling forever, oh oh)
(We're howling forever, oh oh)
(We're howling forever, oh oh)</pre></div>
