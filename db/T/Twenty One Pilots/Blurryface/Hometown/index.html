    <div class="view"><pre>A shadow tilts its head at me
Spirits in the dark are waiting
I won't let the wind go quietly
I won't let the wind go quietly

Be the one, be the one
To take my soul and make it undone
Be the one, be the one
To take me home and show me the sun
I know, I know
You can bring the fire, I can bring the bones
I know, I know
You make the fire and my bones will make it grow

Where we're from, there's no sun
Our hometown's in the dark
Where we're from, we're no one
Our hometown's in the dark
Our hometown's in the dark

A shadow tilts its head at me
Spirits in the dark are waiting
I won't let the wind go quietly
I won't let the wind go quietly

Put away, put away
All the gods your father served today
Put away, put away
Your traditions, believe me when I say
We don't know, we don't know
How to put back the power in our soul
We don't know, we don't know
Where to find what once was in our bones

Where we're from, there's no sun
Our hometown's in the dark
Where we're from, we're no one
Our hometown's in the dark
Our hometown's in the dark

A shadow tilts its head at me
Spirits in the dark are waiting
I won't let the wind go quietly
I won't let the wind go quietly

Where we're from, there's no sun
Our hometown's in the dark
Where we're from, we're no one
Our hometown's in the dark</pre></div>
