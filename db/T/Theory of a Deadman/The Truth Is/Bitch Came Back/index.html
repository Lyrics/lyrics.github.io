<br/><span></span>Don't you know the bitch came back?<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>I like her so much better when she's down on her knees
<br/><span></span>Cause when she's in my face that's when I'm starting to see
<br/><span></span>That all my friends will laugh at thinking that we'd be wrong
<br/><span></span>Well she's so fuckin' stupid that she's singing along<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>The trouble with girls is they're all the same
<br/><span></span>Forget the diamonds and pearls they just want a ring

<br/><span></span>Don't you know the bitch came back?<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>There she goes again just always breaking my balls
<br/><span></span>No matter what I do somehow it's always my fault
<br/><span></span>She says I must be cheating cause I turned off my phone
<br/><span></span>But that's the only frickin' way she'll leave me alone<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>The trouble with girls is is never enough
<br/><span></span>They love to complain and they never shut up
