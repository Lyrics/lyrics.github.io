    <div class="view"><pre>We struggle to our feet
We all yearn to be free
We fight and we're weak
We all come out and grieve

This goddamn life is our disease
But we can't always fucking win
We can always turn the tide
We can all stand up and sing 'never alone'

We fight together, not alone
No matter where our bodies roam
This place is now what we call home

Never alone, never apart
We found each other in the dark
Shed our tears and fight our fears
We are one, the lonely hearts

Never alone, never apart
We found each other in the dark
Shed our tears and fight our fears
We are one, the lonely hearts

Listen, always...
We'll be drowning in our grave
Are we can't stand for ourselves
We have to stay afloat
(We struggle to breathe)

With the word that we try to believe
When I lost my home and find my way home
We can always turn the tide
And we get lost and not be blind, never alone

We fight together, not alone
No matter where our bodies roam
(This place is not away from home)
We are never, ever alone

Never alone, never apart
We found each other in the dark
Shed our tears and fight our fears
We are one, the lonely hearts

Never alone, never apart
We found each other in the dark
Shed our tears and fight our fears
We are one, the lonely hearts

We are not lost here together
We are not lost anymore
We'll turn the tide, we'll calm the storm
We are ready for war
We are not lost here together
We are not lost anymore

Never alone, never apart
We found each other in the dark
Shed our tears and fight our fears
We are one, the lonely hearts

Never alone, never apart
We found each other in the dark
Shed our tears and fight our fears
We are one, the lonely hearts

(Hello? Are you there? Listening? I'm just trying to get in touch man. I've been so fucking, so fucking down lately. Like, I don't know what's happening. I'm just so tired all the time. Trying to sleep. I just, I just lay there quiet. Can't speak cause everyone around me is passed out. My fucking mind's raging. Uh, hello? I don't even know why I called. I think it, I think it might be time for me to leave. Just call it quits. I'm sick of this. It's the same fucking day, every day. I think I sleep, I can't be sure though. It's all the same now. Drink, drink, drink again. I'm tired man. I think it, you don't want to hear this. I'm a mess. I'm sorry man. I just don't know who to turn to. No one really hears me, you know? I speak, at least I think I speak, but no one hears me. I've said enough. Hello? Hello? I shouldn't have called.)
