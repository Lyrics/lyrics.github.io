    <div class="view"><pre>You woke up and rose in silence
Crisis on you you
Turn white you recall that slaughter
You turn sideways
and turning your eyes you see her body
These eyes hurt your soul
These eyes of dark were eyes so tragic
Crisis on you

You're going to rise and fall
You're going to rise and see your life falter

You're going to rise and fall
You're going to rise and see your life falter

No ways to endure that beauty
Crisis on your deepest thoughts and innermost lust
Cry water
These eyes of dark were eyes elliptic
And a graveyard for you a tragedy
To once have seen them
A tortured smile

You're going to rise and fall
You're going to rise and see your life falter

You're going to rise and fall
You're going to rise and see your life falter

Eyes elliptic

The shapes of disgrace
Will make us behave like a nervous Jesus

The shapes of disgrace
Will make us behave like a nervous Jesus

You woke up and rose with silence
Corrupted by sexual desires
Still greater is that bad yearning
For your gazing at those eyes you admired
Your acting has brought you disaster
You'll cry forever more now
You'll cry like salty rain

You're going to rise and fall
You're going to rise and see your life falter

You're going to rise and fall
You're going to rise and see your life falter

You're going to rise and fall
You're going to rise and see your life falter</pre></div>
