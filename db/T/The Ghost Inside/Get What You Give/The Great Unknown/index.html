    <div class="view"><pre>Sometimes we get so low
Downsides are all we see
Your world is swallowed whole
And now you're all alone waiting for me
I put my faith in the ones
I trust to stick it out
Who never tuck their tail and run
That's what friendship's all about.

I'm sick of waiting for my life to come to me
So I singing "I'm not waiting"
You want to know how this all has come to be?
Because I lean on the ones beside me
Go and do what makes you happy
That's what I'm saying
I'm done waiting for my life to come to me
So I'm headed into the great unknown
And I'm not going alone.

Cast aside left to fend for yourself your back is to the sun
Repeat your words over again "I don't need anyone"
In a world that wants nothing more than to break me down
I can take on anything with my true friends around
You could never hold me down.

I'm sick of waiting for my life to come to me
So I'm singing "I'm not waiting"
You want to know how this all has come to be?
Because I lean on the ones beside me
Go and do what makes you happy
That's what I'm saying
I'm done waiting for my life to come to me
So I'm headed into the great unknown.

I put my faith in the tried and true
It's just you and me with nothing to lose
Keep those you trust right by your side
Only the strong will survive.

I put my faith in the tried and true
It's just you and me with nothing to lose
I have the strong ones by my side
It's what's keeping me alive.</pre></div>
