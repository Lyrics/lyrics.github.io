<title>The Ghost Inside â€“ Engine 45 | Lyrics</title>
<meta name="description" content="Grab ahold of me, I&#x27;ve got my arms up. / Pull me out from this darkness. / It&#x27;s so hard for me to see so light up the end of that tunnel. / If it&#x27;s a war you came to see you will never see a waved white flag in front me."/>
