    <div class="view"><pre>You are the deceiver.
No excuse for the years you've spent cold.
Spreading words like fire to build an arm,
Just to watch them burn.
You want to watch them burn.
You can't trust this.

All these false prophets stand before me
Spitting venom just to make you all believe
So full of hate and negativity
It's not the answer. It won't set you free.

You are the deceiver.
No excuse for the years you've spent cold.
Spreading words like fire to build an arm,
Just to watch them burn.
You want to watch them burn.
You can't trust this.

Suffocated by the air that you need
Never leaving the cold
Sacrificing everything you could be
Because it's what you've been told
When you look in the mirror what do you see?
Tell me what do you see. What do you see?
Is it everything that you wanted to be?

I'll reclaim everyone you betrayed
Because the tides will change when you've been sent to your grave.

Overturn the throne. You chose a side doomed for failure.
Overturn the throne. I'm here to turn the tides of war.

You're running with the wolves
Inflicting fatal wounds
You're just a naysayer, that will never be me.</pre></div>
