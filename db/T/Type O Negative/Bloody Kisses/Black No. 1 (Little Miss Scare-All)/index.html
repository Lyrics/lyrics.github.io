    <div class="view"><pre>I went looking for trouble
And boy, I found her

She's in love with herself
She likes the dark
On her milk-white neck
The Devil's mark

Now it's All Hallows' Eve
The moon is full
But will she trick or treat?
I bet she will

She will
(Happy Halloween, baby)

She's got a date at midnight
With Nosferatu
Oh baby, Lily Munster
Ain't got nothing on you

Well, when I called her evil
She just laughed
Well, cast that spell on me
Boo bitch-craft

Yeah, you wanna go out 'cause it's raining and blowing
You can't go out 'cause your roots are showing
Dye 'em black
Ooh, dye 'em black

Black, black, black, black number one
Black, black, black, black number one

Little wolf-skin boots
And clove cigarettes
An erotic funeral
For which she's dressed

Her perfume smells like
Burning leaves
Every day
Is Halloween

Yeah, you wanna go out 'cause it's raining and blowing
You can't go out 'cause your roots are showing
Dye 'em black
Ooh, dye 'em black

Black, black, black, black number one
(She dyes 'em black)
Black, black, black, black number one
(Black number one)

Loving you
Loving you
Love, loving you
Was like loving the dead

Loving you
Loving you
Love, loving you
Was like loving the dead

Loving you was like loving the dead
Loving you was like loving the dead
Loving you was like loving the dead
Was like loving the dead
Was like loving the dead
Was like loving the dead

Sacre bleu

Loving you
Loving you
Love, loving you
Was like loving the dead
(It was like fucking the dead)

Loving you was like loving the dead
Loving you was like loving the dead
Loving you was like loving the dead
Was like loving the dead

Loving you, loving you
Loving you, loving you
Loving you, loving you
Was like loving the dead
Was like loving the dead
Was like loving the dead

Black, black, black, black number one
(She dyes 'em black)
Black, black, black, black number one
(Black number one)

(Ooh yeah)

Black, black, black, black number one
Black, black, black, black number one</pre></div>
