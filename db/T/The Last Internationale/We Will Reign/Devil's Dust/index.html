    <div class="view"><pre>Every morning heading to the mines
Breathing in the devil's dust
You're putting on your time
Doing what you must
So that bills don't fall behind

You didn't need any help then
And you won't be needing any now
You've got a load on your back
A chain around your heart
And the privates tearing us apart

Sometimes I wonder
Where are the dreams we dreamt of
And all the things we wanted
And the time that we lost
To pull it back together

All the nights that I wait for you to come home
And when you do we'd curse and fuss
It ain't that I don't love you
It's 'cause it's too much
And I couldn't tell you enough

But we've made it through all these years
What doesn't kill you only makes you stronger
And baby I know nothing's really changed
Only now we're a little older

Sometimes I wonder
Where are the dreams we dreamt of
And all the things we wanted
And the time that we lost
To pull it back together

Pull it back together

Every day you come home a little more tired
I hear you coughing all through the night
Awaits another year until you retire
When the doctors say "you're not alright"

You didn't need any help then
Surely you'll be needing plenty now
You've got a load on your back
A chain around your heart
And the privates tearing us apart

Sometimes I wonder
Where are the dreams we dreamt of
And all the things we wanted
And the time that we lost
To pull it back together

And the time that we lost
To pull it back together

Pull it back together</pre></div>
