    <div class="view"><pre>And it's all in how you mix the two
And it starts just where the light exists
It's a feeling that you cannot miss
And it burns a hole
Through everyone that feels it

Well, you're never gonna find it
If you're looking for it
Won't come your way, yeah
Well, you'll never find it
If you're looking for it

Should've done something
But I've done it enough
By the way your hands were shaking
Rather waste some time with you

And you never would have thought in the end
How amazing it feels just to live again
It's a feeling that you cannot miss
It burns a hole through everyone that feels it

Well, you're never gonna find it
If you're looking for it
Won't come your way, yeah
Well, you'll never find it
If you're looking for it (looking for it)

Should've done something
But I've done it enough
By the way your hands were shaking
Rather waste some time with you

Should've said something
But I've said it enough
By the way my words were fading
Rather waste some time with you (time with you)
(Waste some time with you)

Should've done something
But I've done it enough
By the way your hands were shaking
Rather waste my time with you

Should've said something
But I've said it enough
By the way my words were fading
Rather waste my time with you

Should've done something
But I've done it enough
By the way my hands were shaking
Rather waste some time with you
(Waste some time with you)
Waste some time with you</pre></div>
