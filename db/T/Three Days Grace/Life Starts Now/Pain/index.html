    <div class="view"><pre>Pain, without love
Pain, I can't get enough
Pain, I like it rough
'Cause I'd rather feel pain than nothing at all

You're sick of feeling numb
You're not the only one
I'll take you by the hand
And I'll show you a world that you can understand

This life is filled with hurt
When happiness doesn't work
Trust me and take my hand
When the lights go out, you will understand

Pain (Pain), without love
Pain (Pain), can't get enough
Pain (Pain), I like it rough
'Cause I'd rather feel pain than nothing at all

Pain (Pain), without love
Pain (Pain), can't get enough
Pain (Pain), I like it rough
'Cause I'd rather feel pain than nothing at all

Anger and agony
Are better than misery
Trust me, I've got a plan
When the lights go off, you will understand

Pain (Pain), without love
Pain (Pain), can't get enough
Pain (Pain), I like it rough
'Cause I'd rather feel pain than nothing at all

Pain (Pain), without love
Pain (Pain), can't get enough
Pain (Pain), I like it rough
'Cause I'd rather feel pain than nothing
Rather feel pain

(I know, I know, I know, I know)
I know that you're wounded
(You know, you know, you know, you know)
That I'm here to save you
(You know, you know, you know, you know)
I'm always here for you
(I know, I know, I know, I know)
That you'll thank me later

Pain, without love
Pain, can't get enough
Pain, I like it rough
'Cause I'd rather feel pain than nothing at all

Pain (Pain), without love
Pain (Pain), can't get enough
Pain (Pain), I like it rough
'Cause I'd rather feel pain than nothing at all

Pain (Pain), without love
Pain (Pain), can't get enough
Pain (Pain), I like it rough
'Cause I'd rather feel pain than nothing at all
Rather feel pain than nothing at all
Rather feel pain</pre></div>
