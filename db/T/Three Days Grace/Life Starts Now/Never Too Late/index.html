<title>Three Days Grace – Never Too Late | Lyrics</title>
<meta name="description" content="This world will never be what I expected / And if I don&#x27;t belong, who would&#x27;ve guessed it? / I will not leave alone everything that I own / To make you feel like it&#x27;s not too late, it&#x27;s never too late / Even if I say it&#x27;"/>
