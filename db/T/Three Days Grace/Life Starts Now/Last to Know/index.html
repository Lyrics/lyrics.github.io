    <div class="view"><pre>She just walked away
Why didn't she tell me, and where do I go tonight?
This isn't happening to me, this can't be happening to me
She didn't say a word, just walked away

You were the first to say that we were not okay
You were the first to lie when we were not alright
This was my first love, she was the first to go
And when she left me for you, I was the last to know

Why didn't she tell me where to go tonight?
She didn't say a word, she just walked away

You were the first to say that we were not okay
You were the first to lie when we were not alright
This was my first love, she was the first to go
And when she left me for you, I was the last to know

I'll be the first to say that now I'm okay
And for the first time I've opened up my eyes
This was my worst love; you'll be the first to go
And when she leaves you for dead, you'll be the last to know

I'll be the first to say that now I'm okay
And for the first time I've opened up my eyes
This was my worst love; you'll be the first to go
And when she leaves you for dead, you'll be the last to know</pre></div>
