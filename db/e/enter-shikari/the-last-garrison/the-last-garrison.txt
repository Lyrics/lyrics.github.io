Can you hear the war-cry?

The adrenaline bursts through the riverbanks
Welcome to the skirmish
I can't feel my legs
Give me morphine
Give me morphine
Give me more!

No doubt
This is a tragedy for all
But it ain't over yet
Head's up and thank fuck you're still alive!

There's still air in my lungs
Still blood in my veins
We're part of the last garrison
Still Alive
There's still air in my lungs
Still blood in my veins
We're part of the last garrison

I wanna lie here and soak up the sun
But do not alight here, you cannot outrun
"This could be the end" he said, "the end my child"
So I made good use of my face and I smiled

Can you hear the war-cry?

The epinephrine plows through the barriers
Welcome to the skirmish
I can't feel my legs
Give me opium
Give me opium
Give me hope!

No doubt
This is a tragedy for all
But it ain't over yet
Head's up and thank fuck you're still alive!

There's still air in my lungs
Still blood in my veins
We're part of the last garrison
Still Alive
There's still air in my lungs
Still blood in my veins
We're part of the last garrison

I wanna lie here and soak up the sun
But do not alight here, you cannot outrun
"This could be the end" he said, "the end my child"
So I made good use of my face and I smiled

Let's toast to the fact we got this far

The adrenaline bursts through the riverbanks
Welcome to the skirmish
The epinephrine plows through the barriers
Welcome to the skirmish
The adrenaline bursts through the riverbanks
Welcome to the skirmish
Heads up and thank fuck your still alive!

There's still air in my lungs
Still blood in my veins
We're part of the last garrison
Still Alive
There's still air in my lungs
Still blood in my veins
We're part of the last garrison

Yeah, you're still alive!
