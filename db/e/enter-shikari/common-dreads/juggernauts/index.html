<title>Enter Shikari â€“ Juggernauts | Lyrics</title>
<meta name="description" content="And I know that we've still got time / But I do not think we're invincible / And I'm thinking that it's a sign / 'Cause I do not think we're invincible / Crushing all in it's path / Crushing all in it's path / Crushing all in it's path / Crushing all in it's path / Now don't get me wrong I love what you've done with the place / I just wish we had a chance to help build it / Instead of just moving into this home of disrepair / And expect it to work, prosper and then share / Constantly relying on consuming to feel content / But only because we've lost touch with this home that we've spent / Trillions of dollars tainting for our wants and not our needs / And now we're growing tired of planting bleary-eyed seeds / And I'm not saying that we could do better / But given a chance we'd try (we'd try) / We'd dig up the earth's timeworn soil / And fill the trench with greedy eyes / And I'm not saying that we could do better / But given a chance we'd try / We'd dig up the earth's timeworn soil / And fill the trench with greedy eyes / I'd imagine, I'd imagine, I'd imagine... / "I'd imagine a day as empires made haste / To colonize, to claim, to control and to contain / We sat patiently in the future, helpless" / Switch! / And I know that we've still got time / But I do not think we're invincible / And I'm thinking that it's a sign / Deep breaths, clenched fists / Here comes another Juggernaut! / Crushing all in it's path / Crushing all in it's path / Crushing all in it's path / Crushing all in it's path / What the hell will happen now? / I really don't know, man! / We'll do what we've always done! / Shut our eyes and hope for the best! / NO! We're gonna face this! / And step out onto the tracks! / Stare it, right, in the face / THOU SHALL NOT PASS! / And I know that we've still got time / But I do not think we're invincible / And I'm thinking that it's a sign / 'Cause I do not think we're invincible / Crushing all in it's path / Crushing all in it's path / Crushing all in it's path / Crushing all in it's path / And I know that we've still got time / But I do not think we're invincible / And I'm thinking that it's a sign / Deep breaths, clenched fists / Here comes another Juggernaut! / And I know that we've still got time / But I do not think we're invincible / And I'm thinking that it's a sign / And I do not think we're invincible / And I hope that we've still got time / 'Cause I do not think we're invincible / The idea of community / Will be something displayed at a museum / _________________ / Name Juggernauts / Artist Enter Shikari / Album Common Dreads"/>
