    <div class="view"><pre>And I know that we've still got time
But I do not think we're invincible
And I'm thinking that it's a sign
'Cause I do not think we're invincible

Crushing all in it's path
Crushing all in it's path
Crushing all in it's path
Crushing all in it's path

Now don't get me wrong I love what you've done with the place
I just wish we had a chance to help build it
Instead of just moving into this home of disrepair
And expect it to work, prosper and then share

Constantly relying on consuming to feel content
But only because we've lost touch with this home that we've spent
Trillions of dollars tainting for our wants and not our needs
And now we're growing tired of planting bleary-eyed seeds

And I'm not saying that we could do better
But given a chance we'd try (we'd try)
We'd dig up the earth's timeworn soil
And fill the trench with greedy eyes

And I'm not saying that we could do better
But given a chance we'd try
We'd dig up the earth's timeworn soil
And fill the trench with greedy eyes

I'd imagine, I'd imagine, I'd imagine...

"I'd imagine a day as empires made haste
To colonize, to claim, to control and to contain
We sat patiently in the future, helpless"

Switch!

And I know that we've still got time
But I do not think we're invincible
And I'm thinking that it's a sign
Deep breaths, clenched fists
Here comes another Juggernaut!

Crushing all in it's path
Crushing all in it's path
Crushing all in it's path
Crushing all in it's path

What the hell will happen now?
I really don't know, man!
We'll do what we've always done!
Shut our eyes and hope for the best!
NO! We're gonna face this!
And step out onto the tracks!
Stare it, right, in the face
THOU SHALL NOT PASS!

And I know that we've still got time
But I do not think we're invincible
And I'm thinking that it's a sign
'Cause I do not think we're invincible

Crushing all in it's path
Crushing all in it's path
Crushing all in it's path
Crushing all in it's path

And I know that we've still got time
But I do not think we're invincible
And I'm thinking that it's a sign
Deep breaths, clenched fists
Here comes another Juggernaut!

And I know that we've still got time
But I do not think we're invincible
And I'm thinking that it's a sign
And I do not think we're invincible

And I hope that we've still got time
'Cause I do not think we're invincible
The idea of community
Will be something displayed at a museum</pre></div>
