And I'm thinking what's the deal
With the facts that they conceal
And I'm thinking what's the harm
In a bit of rhetoric and charm

And I can't quite comprehend
A beginning or an end
No I can't quite stomach this, no

You and me, we're gonna take
To the skies for common sake
We'll fly amongst the cirrus clouds
20,000 feet, we'll clock the crowds
And from that height we'll leak the lies
And unveil the damaged skies
Cause we can't quite stomach this

All I'm trying to say is
You're not, getting any sleep tonight
You're not, getting any sleep tonight
(Getting any sleep, getting any sleep)
(Getting any sleep, getting any sleep)
You're not, getting any sleep tonight
(Getting any sleep, getting any sleep)
(Getting any sleep, any sleep tonight)
You're not, getting any sleep tonight

Sun and sea could power us
No longer cower in oil lust
Chernobyl is still a stain
Of the dangers of this game

I still can't quite comprehend
A beginning or an end
No I can't quite stomach this

All I'm trying to say is
You're not, getting any sleep tonight
You're not, getting any sleep tonight
(Getting any sleep, getting any sleep)
(Getting any sleep, getting any sleep)
You're not, getting any sleep tonight
(Getting any sleep, getting any sleep)
(Getting any sleep, any sleep tonight)
You're not, getting any sleep tonight

We'll embark on our great voyage to the sun
Or we'll be 90 million miles from anything or anyone.

What are we waiting for?
What are we waiting for?
What are we waiting for?

YEAH!

All I'm trying to say is
You're not, getting any sleep tonight
You're not, getting any sleep tonight
(Getting any sleep, getting any sleep)
(Getting any sleep, getting any sleep)
You're not, getting any sleep tonight
(Getting any sleep, getting any sleep)
(Getting any sleep, any sleep tonight)
You're not, getting any sleep tonight

We'll embark on our great voyage to the sun
Or we'll be 90 million miles from anything or anyone

Just like the ocean we won't be pacific anymore
No longer in coexistence with other species, now this is flawed

You're not, getting any sleep tonight
You're not, getting any sleep tonight
(Getting any sleep, getting any sleep)
(Getting any sleep, getting any sleep)
You're not, getting any sleep tonight
(Getting any sleep, getting any sleep)
(Getting any sleep, any sleep tonight)
You're not, getting any sleep tonight
