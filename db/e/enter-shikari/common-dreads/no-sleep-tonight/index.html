<title>Enter Shikari â€“ No Sleep Tonight | Lyrics</title>
<meta name="description" content="And I'm thinking what's the deal / With the facts that they conceal / And I'm thinking what's the harm / In a bit of rhetoric and charm / And I can't quite comprehend / A beginning or an end / No I can't quite stomach this, no / You and me, we're gonna take / To the skies for common sake / We'll fly amongst the cirrus clouds / 20,000 feet, we'll clock the crowds / And from that height we'll leak the lies / And unveil the damaged skies / Cause we can't quite stomach this / All I'm trying to say is / You're not, getting any sleep tonight / You're not, getting any sleep tonight / (Getting any sleep, getting any sleep) / (Getting any sleep, getting any sleep) / You're not, getting any sleep tonight / (Getting any sleep, getting any sleep) / (Getting any sleep, any sleep tonight) / You're not, getting any sleep tonight / Sun and sea could power us / No longer cower in oil lust / Chernobyl is still a stain / Of the dangers of this game / I still can't quite comprehend / A beginning or an end / No I can't quite stomach this / All I'm trying to say is / You're not, getting any sleep tonight / You're not, getting any sleep tonight / (Getting any sleep, getting any sleep) / (Getting any sleep, getting any sleep) / You're not, getting any sleep tonight / (Getting any sleep, getting any sleep) / (Getting any sleep, any sleep tonight) / You're not, getting any sleep tonight / We'll embark on our great voyage to the sun / Or we'll be 90 million miles from anything or anyone. / What are we waiting for? / What are we waiting for? / What are we waiting for? / YEAH! / All I'm trying to say is / You're not, getting any sleep tonight / You're not, getting any sleep tonight / (Getting any sleep, getting any sleep) / (Getting any sleep, getting any sleep) / You're not, getting any sleep tonight / (Getting any sleep, getting any sleep) / (Getting any sleep, any sleep tonight) / You're not, getting any sleep tonight / We'll embark on our great voyage to the sun / Or we'll be 90 million miles from anything or anyone / Just like the ocean we won't be pacific anymore / No longer in coexistence with other species, now this is flawed / You're not, getting any sleep tonight / You're not, getting any sleep tonight / (Getting any sleep, getting any sleep) / (Getting any sleep, getting any sleep) / You're not, getting any sleep tonight / (Getting any sleep, getting any sleep) / (Getting any sleep, any sleep tonight) / You're not, getting any sleep tonight / ______________________ / Name No Sleep Tonight / Artist Enter Shikari / Album Common Dreads"/>
