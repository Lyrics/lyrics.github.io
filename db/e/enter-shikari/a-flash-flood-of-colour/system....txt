There was a house in a field on the side of the cliff
And the waves crashing below were just said to be a myth
So they ignored the warnings from the ships and the docks
Now the house on the cliff is the wreckage on the rocks

There was a house in a field on the side of the cliff
And the waves crashing below were just said to be a myth
So they ignored the warnings from the ships and the docks
Now the house on the cliff is the wreckage on the rocks

Nothing can fix the buildings flawed foundations
But scaffolding and stilts were the laws and legislation
This house was doomed but they didn't care
They invested in a system that was beyond repair

When I was little
I dressed up as an astronaut and explored outter space
I dressed up as a super hero and ran about the place
I dressed up as a fireman and rescued those in need
I dressed up as a doctor and cured every disease

It was crystal clear to me back then
That the only problems that I could face
Would be the same problems that effect us all

But of course this sense of common existence
Was sucked out of me in an instance
As though from birth I could walk but I was forced to crawl

So this is such exciting times
To be alive
Our generations got to fight
To survive
It's in your hands now
The future
Our future!
Our future!
