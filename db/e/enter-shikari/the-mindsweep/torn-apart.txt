A naked eye conspires with fear
To form an idea
So destructive and insincere

Reared in the mind
But outside you'll find
That nature does not align

You see
There's more variation, more variation
There's more within population
Variation, more variation
Than between populations

Ah for too many years
A myth perseveres
The scars are the souvenirs

Defined by your skin
Forget we share kin
We're torn apart

It feels as though we're sinking
I don't know how we'll get to shore again
Sinking, we'll surface through the waves
Sinking, I don't know how we'll get to shore again
Sinking, we'll surface through the waves

You see
There's more variation, more variation
There's more within population
Variation, more variation
Than between population

Look back to the past
We hail from one caste
The division will not last

Defined by your skin
Forget we share kin
We're torn apart

It feels as though we're sinking
I don't know how we'll get to shore again
Sinking, we'll surface through the waves
Sinking, I don't know how we'll get to shore again
Sinking, we'll surface through the waves

Sinking, I don't know how we'll get to shore again
Sinking, we'll surface through the waves

Sinking, I don't know how we'll get to shore again
Sinking, we'll surface through the waves

Sinking, I don't know how we'll get to shore again
Sinking, we'll surface through the waves

Sinking, I don't know how we'll get to shore again
Sinking, we'll surface through the waves
