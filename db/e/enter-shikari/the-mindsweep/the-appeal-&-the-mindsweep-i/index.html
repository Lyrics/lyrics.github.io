You are not alone.</p><p>You have entered volatile territory,<br/>you have started a journey, you're part of this story.<br/>And this, this was just a glimpse, just a glimpse.<br/>You've no idea what you've got yourself into.<br/>You've no idea what you've got yourself into.</p><p>I am a mindsweeper, focus on me.<br/>I am a mindsweeper, focus on me, on me.</p></article></div>
