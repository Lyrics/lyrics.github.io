    <div class="view"><pre>This is an appeal to the struggling and striving
stakeholders of this planet, this floating rock we call Earth.
Alas, that means you.
That means everyone of your acquaintance,
every figure your eyes skim past in the street,
every charlatan still to defeat,
every tender face you find solace in -
now mimic the mindset William Wallace was in.
Dismount, disembark, descend from your existence,
slacken your angst and decant your hate
'cause in the long run they're about as useful
as pouring acid onto your dinner plate.
To muzzled masses that lead lives of deafening desperation:
With Excalibur aloft King Arthur earned the throne
but it's our minds we gotta wrench out of stone.
Don't be fooled by its simplicity, there was never a broadcast made of such urgency
'cause at no time before us did we grasp the scope of this emergency.
Ladle out love and logic by the boatload,
equipped with that cargo you can take any road.
Now grab life, seize time. this fight is for human kind.

I am a mindsweeper, focus on me.
I am a mindsweeper, focus on me.
I will read your mind.

I dart through rapids, through the streams of thought,
then suddenly I started losing my mind.
Catapulting through the uncharted
I could no longer tell if these were your thoughts or mine.

And it was as if I held a mirror up to my soul, held a mirror up to my soul.
It was as if I held a mirror up to my soul.
Who was the author and who was the observer?
Who was the author and who was the observer?
For at the last analysis our thoughts coalesced.

You are not alone. You are not alone.

You have entered volatile territory,
you have started a journey, you're part of this story.
And this, this was just a glimpse, just a glimpse.
You've no idea what you've got yourself into.
You've no idea what you've got yourself into.

I am a mindsweeper, focus on me.
I am a mindsweeper, focus on me, on me.</pre></div>
