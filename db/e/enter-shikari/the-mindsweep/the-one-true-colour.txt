As one child is taught red on his mother's knee (the one true colour)
A neighbour is taught blue on his mother's knee (the one true colour)
With a fervour inherited, it will be subsequently delivered
Ignore the spectrum

Dear whom it may concern,
I feel as though I'm about to crash and burn

But I've no idea to whom this may concern
I'm looking out at all the stars and I learn
There's no one up above to hear me yearn
I'm on my own

Someone has whipped the carpet from beneath my feet
Someone upturned the furniture in my mind

How wondrous the upheaval
It's time to embark...

To dissect is to broaden the adventure
And enrich one's tenure
So do not blunt the surgeon's knife

But, oh, how rich the soil
How wondrous the upheaval
It's time to embark...

But, oh, how rich the soil
How wondrous the upheaval
It's time to embark...

There's so much to explore; there's so much to absorb
And then the atoms that you borrowed
They are returned to the cosmos

There's so much to explore; there's so much to absorb
And then the atoms that you borrowed
They are returned when you're
