I never walked on the moon
I never saw the pyramids
I was never struck by famine or fortune

I'll never experience the world you inhabit
I'll never experience the world you inhabit

I never swam with dolphins
I never sang from a mountain top
I was no inventor and no archaeologist

I fret not, I fret not
For I've made my own discovery
I fret not, I fret not
For I've made my own discovery
I fret not, I fret not, I fret not
I fret not, I fret not, I fret not
Just put your weight on my shoulders

For when I dive into your iris
My brain erupts
Into biochemical mayhem
And I feel like a man with two hearts, with two hearts

I fret not, I fret not
For I've made my own discovery
I fret not, I fret not
For I've made my own discovery
I fret not, I fret not, I fret not
I fret not, I fret not, I fret not
Just put your weight on my shoulders

Put your weight on my shoulders
Put your weight on my shoulders
Put your weight on my shoulders
Put your weight on my shoulders
Put your weight on my shoulders
Put your weight on my shoulders
(So put your weight on my shoulders)
