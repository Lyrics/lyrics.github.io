<title>Enter Shikari â€“ Never Let Go Of The Microscope | Lyrics</title>
<meta name="description" content="Like Socrates I only graze on the slopes / Of the summit of my own ignorance / Like Hippocrates I can affirm that the method of science / Is an appliance that emancipates us from dogma / And slant / And bias (the seasons are changing) / Ah the seasons are changing / The velocities at which we now evolve / Mean we got to dissolve unchecked tradition / But atrocities go untouched under the guise of culture / Committed on another mind another heartbeat / Heartbeat / Heartbeat (the seasons are changing) / Ah the seasons are changing / I've got a sinking feeling / I've got a sinking feeling / I've got a sinking feeling / I've got a sinking feeling / Like Sophocles we now wield the paintbrush / So keep a tight grip on a magnifying glass / Our priorities now that we hold the torch / Mean we got to hold it high to illuminate the dark / And archaic / And vile (the seasons are changing) / Ah the seasons are changing / I've got a sinking feeling / I've got a sinking feeling / I've got a sinking feeling / I've got a sinking feeling / I've got a sinking feeling / I've got a sinking feeling / I've got a sinking feeling / I've got a sinking feeling / I've got a sinking feeling / I've got a sinking feeling / I've got a sinking feeling / I've got a sinking feeling / We swear allegiance to no one / We swear allegiance to no one / We'll never let go of the microscope / No matter how callous the shells / We'll harness the heat of the sun / And we'll burn you out of fucking existence / ____________________________________ / Name Never Let Go Of The Microscope / Artist Enter Shikari / Album The Mindsweep"/>
