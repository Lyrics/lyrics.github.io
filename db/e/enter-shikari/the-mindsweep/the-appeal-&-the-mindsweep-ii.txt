Eugh!

I am a Mindsweeper
Focus on me
I am a Mindsweeper
Focus on me

I will read your mind

It goes on and on

It goes on through volatile territory
Through the plains of adversity and the ravines of neurosis
Through the veins of gods and the valley of death

But remember, but remember, you are not alone
And we dance like knights

Here come the cavalry
Here come the cavalry
Oh am I glad to see your face

Sorry you're not a winner
With the air so cold and a mind so bitter
Take it away, boys!

I'm in the mood
I'm in the mood

The same blood gushes through my veins
Feel it surge
Feel it surge
Sweep through the jet streams
Down axons
And across synapses

Mutato nomine, de te fabula narratur
Mutato nomine, de te fabula narratur
