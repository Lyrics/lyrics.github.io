<title>Enter Shikari â€“ Mothership | Lyrics</title>
<meta name="description" content="Go tell all your friends that this is the end / Go tell all your friends that this is the end / Go tell all your friends that this is the end / This is the end / I don't understand a word you're saying / what are the clouds running from? / There's something in the air tonight / Something is wrong, spit it out! / I just fell from that Mothership / They said that / Your answers, they're always lying on the ocean bed / Your answers, they're always lying on the ocean bed / There's something in the air / There's something in the air / In the air, in the air / Tonight, I'm wide awake, I'm wide awake / In the air, in the air / Tonight, I'm wide awake, I'm wide awake / And I'll scream with a thousand voices... / I am sane / I am sane / My soul felt so safe up there / No self-centred natives destroying our earth / I just fell from that Mothership / They said that / Your answers, they're always lying on the ocean bed / Your answers (your answers, your answers) they're always lying on the ocean bed / Walk the plank, walk the plank, walk the plank / Walk the plank, walk the plank, walk the plank / Walk the plank / Your answers they're always lying on the ocean bed / Your answers they're always lying on the ocean bed / Your answers they're always lying on the ocean bed / Your answers they're always lying on the ocean bed / Demo Version / Go tell all your friends that this is the end / Go tell all your friends that this is the end / Go tell all your friends that this is the end / This is the end / I don't understand a word you're saying / What are the clouds running from? / There's something in the air tonight / Something is wrong, spit it out! / I just fell from the mothership / (they said that) / Your answers, they're always lying on the ocean bed / Your answers, they're always lying on the ocean bed / There's something in the air / There's something in the air / Tonight, i'm wide awake, i'm wide awake / There's something in the air / There's something in the air / Tonight, i'm wide awake, i'm wide awake / And i'll plead with a thousand voices / I am sane! I am sane! / I just fell from the mothership / (they said that) / Your answers, they're always lying on the ocean bed / Your answers, they're always lying on the ocean bed / Walk the plank! walk the plank! walk the plank! / Walk the plank! walk the plank! walk the plank! / Walk, the, plank! / Your answers, they're always lying on the ocean bed / Your answers, they're always lying on the ocean bed / Your answers, they're always lying on the ocean bed / Your answers, they're always lying on the ocean bed / ________________ / Name Mothership / Artist Enter Shikari / Album Take To The Skies"/>
