Go tell all your friends that this is the end
Go tell all your friends that this is the end
Go tell all your friends that this is the end
This is the end

I don't understand a word you're saying
what are the clouds running from?
There's something in the air tonight
Something is wrong, spit it out!

I just fell from that Mothership
They said that
Your answers, they're always lying on the ocean bed
Your answers, they're always lying on the ocean bed

There's something in the air
There's something in the air
In the air, in the air
Tonight, I'm wide awake, I'm wide awake
In the air, in the air
Tonight, I'm wide awake, I'm wide awake

And I'll scream with a thousand voices...
I am sane
I am sane
My soul felt so safe up there
No self-centred natives destroying our earth

I just fell from that Mothership
They said that
Your answers, they're always lying on the ocean bed
Your answers (your answers, your answers) they're always lying on the ocean bed

Walk the plank, walk the plank, walk the plank
Walk the plank, walk the plank, walk the plank
Walk the plank
Your answers they're always lying on the ocean bed
Your answers they're always lying on the ocean bed
Your answers they're always lying on the ocean bed
Your answers they're always lying on the ocean bed
