Scratch card glory or waist low pleasure?
Black eyes nose bleeds don't look back now
My white abode do you remember?
My white abode
But it's such a thrill just to find out...

Sorry you're not a winner
With the air so cold and a mind so bitter
What have you got to loose
But false intentions and a life so pretentious?

I sweat I ache...

Sorry you're not a winner
With the air so cold and a mind so bitter

But false intentions and a life so pretentious?

To loose but false intentions
And a life so pretentious?
