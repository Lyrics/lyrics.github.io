    <div class="view"><div id="lyrics">His eyes are locked on her
Her eyes are fixed elsewhere
He's confident
But he's not aware
She doesn't care

Their only connection
Is the silence they both grasp
He's lost control
But she's not aware
Of his stare

Everything seems to intimidate him
With the strobe lights flashing
Her body's jolting
But cracking
As his eyes
Spilt in two
If only she knew...

If only she knew...
If only...
If only she knew...

The curtain goes down
On him again
The curtain goes down
On him again

Everything seems to be closing in on her
It feels just like she is being hunted
But its all right
It's all good
She's not aware
Of his stare

We've had this date from the beginning
We've had this date from the beginning

The curtain goes down
On him again
The curtain goes down
On him again

Who remains when the curtain falls?
Who remains when the curtain goes down?
(on him, him, him, him)
Who remains when the curtain falls?
Who remains when the curtain goes down?</div></div>
