<title>Enter Shikari â€“ Anything Can Happen In The Next Half Hour | Lyrics</title>
<meta name="description" content="His eyes are locked on her / Her eyes are fixed elsewhere / He's confident / But he's not aware / She doesn't care / Their only connection / Is the silence they both grasp / He's lost control / But she's not aware / Of his stare / Everything seems to intimidate him / With the strobe lights flashing / Her body's jolting / But cracking / As his eyes / Spilt in two / If only she knew... / If only she knew... / If only... / If only she knew... / The curtain goes down / On him again / The curtain goes down / On him again / Everything seems to be closing in on her / It feels just like she is being hunted / But its all right / It's all good / She's not aware / Of his stare / We've had this date from the beginning / We've had this date from the beginning / The curtain goes down / On him again / The curtain goes down / On him again / Who remains when the curtain falls? / Who remains when the curtain goes down? / (on him, him, him, him) / Who remains when the curtain falls? / Who remains when the curtain goes down? / _______________________________________________ / Name Anything Can Happen In The Next Half Hour / Artist Enter Shikari / Album Take To The Skies"/>
