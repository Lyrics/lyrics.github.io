Shadows fall on yesterday,
it's like time just slips away.
I'm nothing, when darkness follows me.
The dawn, it never shows its head.
I'm left dying here instead with nothing,
a lock without a key.

Like the brightest star you shine through. Ashley, baby, you make me feel so alive.
I've got purpose once again.
Yeah, yeah.
Ashley, baby, you make me feel so alive.
I've got purpose once again.
Yeah, yeah.
(I've got purpose once again.)

If looks could kill you'd be the one,
that takes my world and makes me numb.
I'm nothing, without you I can't breathe.
(I can't breathe.)
And as the sunlight burns the sky,
I see through my obsessive eyes.
I'm nothing, without you I cant see.

Like the brightest star you shine through.
Ashley, baby, you make me feel so alive.
I've got purpose once again.
Yeah, yeah.
Ashley, baby, you make me feel so alive.
I've got purpose once again.
Yeah, yeah.
Yeah, yeah.

You're the strength i need to fight,
You're the reason i still try.
I'm the moth and you're the light.
Use these wings so i can fly,
I can fly.

Ashley, baby, you make me feel so alive.
I've got purpose once again.
Yeah, yeah.
Ashley, baby, you make me feel so alive.
I've got purpose once again.
Yeah, yeah.
Ashley, baby, you make me feel so alive.
I've got purpose once again.
Yeah, yeah.
Yeah, yeah.

I've got purpose once again.
I've got purpose once again
