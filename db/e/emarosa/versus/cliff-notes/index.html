<title>Emarosa â€“ Cliff Notes | Lyrics</title>
<meta name="description" content="This isn't war / This isn't courage / This isn't how you're supposed to be / And all the things keeping you awake / Are leaving me afraid / This isn't war / This isn't courage / And I don't believe that you're okay / The reason why I forget to close my eyes / When you're next to me / I feel you're going to leave / When birthdays are suicide days / And waking up it's hard to stay / I want to see you when you come down / So save yourself for me / I want to see you when you come down / So save yourself / The weight of loves forever trying / And it's enough to bury me / All the things keeping you awake / Are leaving finally / When birthdays are suicide days / And waking up it's hard to stay / I want to see you when you come down / So save yourself for me / I want to see you when you come down / So save yourself / Always said the same way I'm okay / Always walk away in chains / You know we wish you'd come around / Because nothing's changed / But it doesn't feel the same / I want to see you when you come down / So save yourself for me / I want to see you when you come down / So save yourself / _________________ / Name Cliff Notes / Artist Emarosa / Album Versus"/>
