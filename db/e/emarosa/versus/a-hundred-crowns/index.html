<title>Emarosa â€“ A Hundred Crowns | Lyrics</title>
<meta name="description" content="Something in the way you want to be deceived / I see you sell yourself / You can trust your faith if it helps you to believe / For me it never helped / You can never suffer dissent / Never dreamt of leaving you again / And I can't pretend though I want you to / You've been a saint you can be again / I can't move on / Believe in anybody else / Until you are dead and gone or living again / Say you're something more than what shows / Because it's been so long / I need your hands intertwined again just to feel at home / You can never suffer dissent / Never dreamt of leaving you again / And I can't pretend though I want you to / You've been a saint you can be again / I can't move on / Believe in anybody else / Until you are dead and gone or living again / We end and begin / I can't stop dreaming / But I've been awake all along / To see you and break through is all I need to do / But I cannot stay when you're wrong / I cannot stay when you're gone / ______________________ / Name A Hundred Crowns / Artist Emarosa / Album Versus"/>
