It pays to be insane
Indiana rain
I let go
And I made the same mistakes
Sleeping in the flame
I lost hope
Just to be alone

Afraid I'll be my father and fade away
We almost sound the same
Afraid I'll be forgotten but I can't change

I need to hear you say please don't look away
I still want to let you let me in even when it ends
If you need to love me
Love me patiently just until you see I'm giving up
And just to make sure I've wasted all doubt
Just to make sure please wake me up now
And what won't let me down is my fear

Afraid I'll be my father and fade away
We almost sound the same
Afraid I'll be forgotten but I can't change

I'm broken and it's hurting
And all you say is love me too
Don't take it if you know it's not enough
Maybe I'll be more tomorrow

Afraid I'll be my father and fade away
We almost sound the same
Afraid I'll be forgotten but I can't change
