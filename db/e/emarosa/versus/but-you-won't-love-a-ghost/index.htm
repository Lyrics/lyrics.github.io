<div><pre>Somebody ought to draw the line
Having you next to me
We were both afraid to say what we think
It's part of the poetry
If I let you go and I walk away it's done
But isn't it enough to say I won't
Isn't it enough to say I can't?
And I just keep away for you
Keep away for me
You were a song to sing
A way to say I need you more
You need to stay

You'll see me again
Is it right or wrong?
You'll see me again
We go on and on
It's worth the wait
And all this time I've had to change
You'll see me again
I know it won't be long

When it's hard to break it's hard to take
And the reasons why I never made it through
And I never gave you all the things that I wanted to
If I let you go and I walk away for reasons I will never know
I break
You pray

You'll see me again
Is it right or wrong?
You'll see me again
We go on and on
It's worth the wait
And all this time I've had to change
You'll see me again
I know it won't be long

But you won't love a ghost
I don't and I feel you in my throat
Another taste of love
You'll never know
Never wait for it 'and now the hand you hold
Is now the hand that holds you down

You'll see me again
Is it right or wrong?
You'll see me again
We go on and on
It's worth the wait
And all this time I've had to change
You'll see me again</pre></div>
