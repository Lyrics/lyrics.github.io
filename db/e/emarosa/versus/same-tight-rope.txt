Nothing left running alone
Everything was moving fast
Keeping pace with planes above
Nothing ever seems to last
I'm sorry you can't see where I'm running from
I hope to get away
Forget the way I sing the same old songs
But I always sing along

When all is said and done
On the run it's not where I want to be
No, it'll all remain the same if I change
You'll see oh my love is it ever enough?
Because everybody seem to feel the same
And I don't know if I have a line
A line to make you want to wait
So now I'm guilt stricken silent with my head on the floor
And I'll never be the same
So to get away forget the way I play
The same old songs and make the same mistakes

When all is said and done
On the run it's not where I want to be
No, it'll all remain the same if I change
You'll see me when it's done

And I'm learning not to love
Part of me going through emotions I can't show
Going through the motions of regret
I let go
And I'm learning I'm alone suddenly living in the moment
You both know you're falling from the same tight rope

When all is said and done
On the run it's not where I want to be
No, it'll all remain the same if I change
You'll see me when it's done
