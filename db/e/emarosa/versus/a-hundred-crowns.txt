Something in the way you want to be deceived
I see you sell yourself
You can trust your faith if it helps you to believe
For me it never helped
You can never suffer dissent
Never dreamt of leaving you again
And I can't pretend though I want you to
You've been a saint you can be again

I can't move on
Believe in anybody else
Until you are dead and gone or living again

Say you're something more than what shows
Because it's been so long
I need your hands intertwined again just to feel at home
You can never suffer dissent
Never dreamt of leaving you again
And I can't pretend though I want you to
You've been a saint you can be again

I can't move on
Believe in anybody else
Until you are dead and gone or living again

We end and begin
I can't stop dreaming
But I've been awake all along
To see you and break through is all I need to do
But I cannot stay when you're wrong
I cannot stay when you're gone
