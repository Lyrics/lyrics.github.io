Better find a way
Better find a way
To tell you got to make amends
Don't wait until it's done
I know I had it all
But say hello

Wait for nothing
You will find my failures
You will let me go
And you'll know
You had it all
But say hello
Wait for me

Well I never had faith
I never had love
Do you believe in me?
You can have me but I'm broken in two
So say hello
Wait for me

And you wait for something on your own
And you wait for something all alone
