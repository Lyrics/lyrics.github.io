<div><pre>I ain't a ghost man
You can see my feet walking on
And I ain't dead yet
I am singing songs so sing along

And you can let em' know I took what I was looking for
And you can let em' know I took it cause' they couldn't, no

I ain't a bad man
You could say that I am still my mother's son.
And I ain't seeing red
I am seeing everything I never was

And you can let em' know I took what I was looking for
And you can let em' know I took it cause' they couldn't, no
So where do we go from here?

I played the wrong hand on the other hand I played it right
And I'm taking up a throne that was already ready already mine

And you can let em' know I took what I was looking for
And you can let em' know I took it cause' they couldn't, no
So where do we go from here?

You walked away
I walked away
And now that I'm gone
Is it sinking in?
And now that I'm home
Is it sinking in alone?</pre></div>
