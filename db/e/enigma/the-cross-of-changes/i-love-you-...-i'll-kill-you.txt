I see love, I can see passion
I feel danger, I feel obsession
Don't play games with the ones who love you
Cause I hear a voice who says:
I love you, I'll kill you

Loneliness, I feel loneliness in my room
Loneliness, I feel loneliness in my room

(bring it back, bring it back...)
(bring it back, bring it back...)

Loneliness, I feel loneliness in my room
Loneliness, I feel loneliness in my room

(bring it back, bring it back...)
(bring it back, bring it back...)

Loneliness, I feel loneliness in my room

(bring it back, bring it back...)
(bring it back, bring it back...)

(bring it back, bring it back...)
(bring it back, bring it back...)

Look into the mirror of you soul
Love and hate are one in all
Sacrifice turns to revenge and believe me
You will see the face who'll say:
I love you, I'll kill you
But I'll love you forever

Loneliness, I feel loneliness in my room
Loneliness, I feel loneliness in my room

(bring it back, bring it back...)
(bring it back, bring it back...)

Loneliness, I feel loneliness in my room

(bring it back, bring it back...)
(bring it back, bring it back...)

(bring it back, bring it back...)
(bring it back, bring it back...)
