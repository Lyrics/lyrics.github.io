    <div class="view"><div id="lyrics">This is a waking up
This is your final go
And I would never want to see you
Get torn apart
And I can't believe
I can't believe your apart of this world
You were a sick sad man from the start
And your not even worth my time
I can't be stopped
I'll just keep going all the way
You will try
But you will fail
Just say
It's over and it's done with
I drove around Chicago
Heading to Champaign
I passed right through a country
With a gorge as high as any
God has ever made
I saw a man beside the road
He said "Excuse me sir I think I've lost my way"
Then I told him as I pulled back
On the road and headed south
I've got no time to waste
I said I guess you don't have faith
I guess you don't have faith
I guess you don't have faith
It doesn't matter anyway
It's the way
It's the way you want it
Everything
Everything in this place
It's the way
It's the way you want it
Everything
Everything in this place
I guess you don't have faith
I guess you don't have faith
I guess you don't have faith
This is a waking up
This is your final go
So don't you expect me to be there
When you fall
When you fall</div></div>
