We should be together, too</p><p>My tea's gone cold I'm wondering why I<br/>Got out of bed at all<br/>The morning rain clouds up my window<br/>And I can't see at all<br/>And even if I could it'll all be gray, but your picture on my wall<br/>It reminds me that it's not so bad, it's not so bad</p><p>Dear Mr. I'm-Too-Good-To-Call-Or-Write-My-Fans:<br/>This'll be the last package I ever send your ass!<br/>It's been six months and still no word, I don't deserve it?<br/>I know you got my last two letters; I wrote the addresses on 'em perfect</p><p>So this is my cassette I'm sending you, I hope you hear it<br/>I'm in the car right now, I'm doing 90 on the freeway<br/>Hey Slim, I drank a fifth of vodka, you dare me to drive?<br/>You know the song by Phil Collins, In the Air of the Night?</p><p>About that guy who coulda saved that other guy from drowning?<br/>But didn't, then Phil saw it all, then at a show he found him?<br/>That's kinda how this is, you coulda rescued me from drowning<br/>Now it's too late, I'm on a thousand downers now, I'm drowsy</p><p>And all I wanted was a lousy letter or a call<br/>I hope you know I ripped all of your pictures off the wall<br/>I love you Slim, we coulda been together, think about it<br/>You ruined it now, I hope you can't sleep and you dream about it</p><p>And when you dream, I hope you can't sleep and you scream about it<br/>I hope your conscience eats at you and you can't breathe without me<br/>See Slim; shut up bitch! I'm tryin' to talk!<br/>Hey Slim, that's my girlfriend screamin' in the trunk</p><p>But I didn't slit her throat, I just tied her up, see I ain't like you<br/>'Cause if she suffocates, she'll suffer more and then she'll die too<br/>Well, gotta go, I'm almost at the bridge now - Oh, shit! I forgot!<br/>How am I supposed to send this shit out?</p><p>My tea's gone cold I'm wondering why I<br/>Got out of bed at all<br/>The morning rain clouds up my window<br/>And I can't see at all<br/>And even if I could it'll all be gray, but your picture on my wall<br/>It reminds me that it's not so bad, it's not so bad</p><p>Dear Stan, I meant to write you sooner but I just been busy<br/>You said your girlfriend's pregnant now, how far along is she?<br/>Look, I'm really flattered you would call your daughter that<br/>And here's an autograph for your brother, I wrote it on the Starter cap</p><p>I'm sorry I didn't see you at the show, I musta missed you<br/>Don't think I did that shit intentionally just to diss you<br/>But what's this shit you said about you like to cut your wrists too?<br/>I say that shit just clownin' dogg; c'mon, how fucked up is you?</p><p>You got some issues Stan, I think you need some counselling<br/>To help your ass from bouncing off the walls when you get down some<br/>And what's this shit about us meant to be together?<br/>That type of shit'll make me not want us to meet each other!</p><p>I really think you and your girlfriend need each other<br/>Or maybe you just need to treat her better<br/>I hope you get to read this letter, I just hope it reaches you in time<br/>Before you hurt yourself, I think that you'll be doin' just fine</p><p>If you relax a little, I'm glad I inspire you, but Stan<br/>Why are you so mad? Try to understand, that I do want you as a fan<br/>I just don't want you to do some crazy shit<br/>I seen this one shit on the news a couple weeks ago that made me sick</p><p>Some dude was drunk and drove his car over a bridge<br/>And had his girlfriend in the trunk and she was pregnant with his kid<br/>And in the car they found a tape, but they didn't say who it was to<br/>Come to think of it, his name was... it was you!<br/>Damn...</p></article></div>
