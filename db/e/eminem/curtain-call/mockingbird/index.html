it's got a ring to it, don't it?<span><br/></span>Shh, mama's only gone for the moment<span><br/></span><span class="g"><br/></span>Now hush little baby, don't you cry<span><br/></span>Everything's gonna be all right<span><br/></span>Stiffen that upper lip up little lady, I told ya<span><br/></span>Daddy's here to hold ya through the night<span><br/></span><span class="g"><br/></span>I know mommy's not here right now, and we don't know why<span><br/></span>We fear how we feel inside<span><br/></span>It may seem a little crazy, pretty baby<span><br/></span>But I promise mama's gon' be all right<span><br/></span><span class="g"><br/></span>And if you ask me, too, daddy's gonna buy you a mockingbird<span><br/></span>I'mma give you the world<span><br/></span>I'mma buy a diamond ring for you, I'mma sing for you<span><br/></span>I'll do anything for you to see you smile<span><br/></span><span class="g"><br/></span>And if that mockingbird don't sing and that ring don't shine<span><br/></span>I'mma break that birdie's neck<span><br/></span>I'd go back to the jeweler who sold it to ya<span><br/></span>And make him eat every karat;
