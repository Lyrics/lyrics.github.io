    <div class="view"><article id="lyrics"><p>Yeah, I know sometimes, things may not always make sense to you right now<br/>But hey, what daddy always tell you?<br/>Straighten up little soldier, stiffen up that upper lip<br/>What you crying about?<br/>You got me</p><p>Hailie, I know you miss your mom, and I know you miss your dad<br/>When I'm gone, but I'm trying to give you the life that I never had<br/>I can see you're sad, even when you smile, even when you laugh<br/>I can see it in your eyes, deep inside, you want to cry</p><p>'Cause you're scared; I ain't there? Daddy's with you in your prayers<br/>No more crying, wipe them tears; daddy's here, no more nightmares<br/>We gon' pull together through it, we gon' do it<br/>Laney uncle's crazy, ain't he? Yeah, but he loves you girl and you better know it</p><p>We're all we got in this world When it spins, when it swirls<br/>When it whirls, when it twirls two little beautiful girls<br/>Lookin' puzzled, in a daze. I know it's confusin' you<br/>Daddy's always on the move; mama's always on the news</p><p>I try to keep you sheltered from it, but somehow it seems<br/>The harder that I try to do that, the more it backfires on me<br/>All the things growing up his daddy that he had to see<br/>Daddy don't want you to see, but you see just as much as he did</p><p>We did not plan it to be this way, your mother and me<br/>But things have gotten so bad between us, I don't see us ever being together<br/>Ever again, like we used to be when we was teenagers<br/>But then of course everything always happens for a reason</p><p>I guess it was never meant to be<br/>But it's just something we have no control over, and that's what destiny is<br/>But no more worries, rest your head, and go to sleep<br/>Maybe one day we'll wake up, and this will all just be a dream</p><p>Now hush little baby, don't you cry<br/>Everything's gonna be all right<br/>Stiffen that upper lip up little lady, I told ya<br/>Daddy's here to hold ya through the night</p><p>I know mommy's not here right now, and we don't know why<br/>We fear how we feel inside<br/>It may seem a little crazy, pretty baby<br/>But I promise mama's gon' be all right</p><p>It's funny, I remember back one year, when daddy had no money<br/>Mommy wrapped the Christmas presents up and stuck 'em under the tree<br/>And said some of 'em were from me, 'cause daddy couldn't buy 'em<br/>I'll never forget that Christmas; I sat up the whole night crying</p><p>'Cause daddy felt like a bum, see daddy had a job<br/>But his job was to keep the food on the table for you and mom<br/>And at the time, every house that we lived in either kept getting broke into and robbed or shot up on the block</p><p>And your mom was saving money for you in a jar<br/>Tryma start a piggy bank for you so you could go to college<br/>Almost had a thousand dollars, till someone broke in and stole it<br/>And I know it hurt so bad, it broke your mama's heart<br/>And it seemed like everything was just startin' to fall apart</p><p>Mom and dad was arguin' a lot, so mama moved back<br/>On the Chalmers in the flat—one bedroom apartment<br/>And dad moved back to the other side of 8 Mile on Novara<br/>And that's when daddy went to California with his CD<br/>And met Dr. Dre and flew you and mama out to see me</p><p>But daddy had to work, you and momma had to leave me<br/>Then you started seeing daddy on the TV<br/>And mama didn't like it and you and Laney were to young to understand it<br/>Papa was a Rollin' Stone, momma developed a habit<br/>And it all happened too fast for either one of us to grab it<br/>I'm just sorry you were there and had to witness it first hand</p><p>'Cause all I ever wanted to do was just make you proud<br/>Now I'm sittin' in this empty house<br/>Just reminiscing lookin' at your baby pictures, it just trips me out<br/>To see how much you both have grown, it's almost like you're sisters now</p><p>Wow, guess you pretty much are and, daddy's still here<br/>Laney I'm talkin' to you too: Daddy's still here<br/>I like the sound of that, yeah; it's got a ring to it, don't it?<br/>Shh, mama's only gone for the moment</p><p>Now hush little baby, don't you cry<br/>Everything's gonna be all right<br/>Stiffen that upper lip up little lady, I told ya<br/>Daddy's here to hold ya through the night</p><p>I know mommy's not here right now, and we don't know why<br/>We fear how we feel inside<br/>It may seem a little crazy, pretty baby<br/>But I promise mama's gon' be all right</p><p>And if you ask me, too, daddy's gonna buy you a mockingbird<br/>I'mma give you the world<br/>I'mma buy a diamond ring for you, I'mma sing for you<br/>I'll do anything for you to see you smile</p><p>And if that mockingbird don't sing and that ring don't shine<br/>I'mma break that birdie's neck<br/>I'd go back to the jeweler who sold it to ya<br/>And make him eat every karat; don't fuck with dad (haha)</p></article></div>
