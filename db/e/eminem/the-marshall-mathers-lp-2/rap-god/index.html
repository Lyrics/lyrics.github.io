    <div class="view"><article id="lyrics"><p>Look, I was gonna go easy on you, not to hurt your feelings<br/>But I'm only going to get this one chance<br/>Something's wrong, I can feel it (Six minutes, Slim Shady, you're on)<br/>Just a feeling I've got, like something's about to happen, but I don't know what<br/>If that means what I think it means, we're in trouble – big trouble<br/>And if he is bananas as you say, I'm not taking any chances<br/>You are just what the doctor ordered</p><p>I'm beginning to feel like a Rap God, Rap God<br/>All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod<br/>Now who thinks their arms are long enough to slapbox, slapbox?<br/>They said I rap like a robot, so call me Rapbot</p><p>But for me to rap like a computer must be in my genes<br/>I got a laptop in my back pocket<br/>My pen'll go off when I half-cock it<br/>Got a fat knot from that rap profit</p><p>Made a living and a killing off it<br/>Ever since Bill Clinton was still in office<br/>With Monica Lewinsky feeling on his nut-sack<br/>I'm an MC still as honest</p><p>But as rude and indecent as all hell<br/>Syllables skill-a-holic (Kill 'em all with)<br/>This slickety-gippety-hippity-hip-hop<br/>You don't really wanna get into a pissing match with this rappity-rap<br/>Packing a Mack in the back of the Ac, backpack rap, yap-yap, yacketty-yack</p><p>And now at the exact same time<br/>I attempt these lyrical acrobat stunts while I'm practicing that<br/>I'll still be able to break a motherfuckin' table<br/>Over the back of a couple of faggots and crack it in half</p><p>Only realized it was ironic I was signed to Aftermath after the fact<br/>How could I not blow? All I do is drop F-bombs, feel my wrath of attack<br/>Rappers are having a rough time period, here's a maxi-pad<br/>It's actually disastrously bad for the wack<br/>While I'm masterfully constructing this masterpiece, yeah</p><p>'Cause I'm beginning to feel like a Rap God, Rap God<br/>All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod<br/>Now who thinks their arms are long enough to slapbox, slapbox?<br/>Let me show you maintaining this shit ain't that hard, that hard</p><p>Everybody want the key and the secret to rap immortality like I have got<br/>Well, to be truthful the blueprint's simply rage and youthful exuberance<br/>Everybody loves to root for a nuisance<br/>Hit the earth like an asteroid, I did nothing but shoot for the moon since<br/>*pew*</p><p>MCs get taken to school with this music<br/>'Cause I use it as a vehicle to bust the rhyme<br/>Now I lead a new school full of students<br/>Me? I'm a product of Rakim, Lakim Shabazz, 2Pac, N-<br/>-W.A, Cube, hey Doc, Ren, Yella, Eazy, thank you, they got Slim</p><p>Inspired enough to one day grow up, blow up, and be in a position<br/>To meet Run-D.M.C. and induct them into the motherfuckin' Rock n'<br/>Roll Hall of Fame<br/>Even though I'll walk in the church and burst in a ball of flames<br/>Only Hall of Fame I be inducted in is the alcohol of fame<br/>On the wall of shame<br/>You fags think it's all a game till I walk a flock of flames<br/>Off a plank and, tell me what in the fuck are you thinking?<br/>Little gay looking boy</p><p>So gay I can barely say it with a straight face looking boy<br/>You witnessing a massacre<br/>Like you watching a church gathering take place looking boy<br/>Oy vey, that boy's gay, that's all they say looking boy<br/>You get a thumbs up, pat on the back<br/>And a way to go from your label everyday looking boy<br/>Hey, looking boy, what you say looking boy?<br/>I get a "hell yeah" from Dre looking boy<br/>I'mma work for everything I have<br/>Never asked nobody for that shit, get outta my face looking boy<br/>Basically boy you're never gonna be capable<br/>Of keeping up with the same pace looking boy</p><p>'Cause I'm beginning to feel like a Rap God, Rap God<br/>All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod<br/>The way I'm racing around the track, call me Nascar, Nascar<br/>Dale Earnhardt of the trailer park, the White Trash God<br/>Kneel before General Zod this planet's Krypton, no Asgard, Asgard</p><p>So you be Thor and I'll be Odin, you rodent, I'm omnipotent<br/>Let off then I'm reloading immediately with these bombs I'm totin'<br/>And I should not be woken<br/>I'm the walking dead, but I'm just a talking head, a zombie floating<br/>But I got your mom deep throating</p><p>I'm out my Ramen noodle, we have nothing in common, poodle<br/>I'm a Doberman, pinch yourself in the arm and pay homage, pupil<br/>It's me, my honesty's brutal<br/>But it's honestly futile if I don't utilize what I do though</p><p>For good at least once in a while<br/>So I wanna make sure somewhere in this chicken scratch I scribble and doodle<br/>Enough rhymes to maybe try to help get some people through tough times<br/>But I gotta keep a few punchlines just in case 'cause even you unsigned<br/>Rappers are hungry looking at me like it's lunchtime<br/>I know there was a time where once I<br/>Was king of the underground, but I still rap like I'm on my Pharoahe Monch grind</p><p>So I crunch rhymes, but sometimes when you combine<br/>Appeal with the skin color of mine<br/>You get too big and here they come trying to censor you<br/>Like that one line I said on "I'm Back" from The Mathers LP<br/>One where I tried to say I'd take seven kids from Columbine<br/>Put 'em all in a line, add an AK-47, a revolver and a nine<br/>See if I get away with it now that I ain't as big as I was, but I'm</p><p>Morphin' into an immortal coming through the portal<br/>You're stuck in a time warp from 2004 though<br/>And I don't know what the fuck that you rhyme for<br/>You're pointless as Rapunzel with fucking cornrows<br/>You write normal, fuck being normal<br/>And I just bought a new raygun from the future</p><p>To just come and shoot ya like when Fabolous made Ray J mad<br/>'Cause Fab said he looked like a fag at Maywhether's pad<br/>Singin' to a man while he played piano<br/>Man, oh, man, that was the 24/7 special on the cable channel<br/>So Ray J went straight to the radio station the very next day<br/>"Hey, Fab, I'mma kill you"<br/>Lyrics coming at you at supersonic speed, JJ Fad</p><p>Uh, sama lamaa duma lamaa you assuming I'm a human<br/>What I gotta do to get it through to you I'm superhuman<br/>Innovative and I'm made of rubber<br/>So that anything you say is ricocheting off of me and it'll glue to you<br/>I'm devastating, more than never demonstrating<br/>How to give a motherfuckin' audience a feeling like it's levitating<br/>Never fading, and I know the haters are forever waiting<br/>For the day that they can say I fell off, they'll be celebrating<br/>'Cause I know the way to get 'em motivated<br/>I make elevating music, you make elevator music<br/>Oh, he's too mainstream<br/>Well, that's what they do when they get jealous, they confuse it<br/>It's not hip-hop, it's pop, 'cause I found a hella way to fuse it<br/>With rock, shock rap with Doc<br/>Throw on Lose Yourself and make 'em lose it</p><p>I don't know how to make songs like that<br/>I don't know what words to use<br/>Let me know when it occurs to you<br/>While I'm ripping any one of these verses diverse as you<br/>It's curtains, I'm inadvertently hurtin' you<br/>How many verses I gotta murder to prove<br/>That if you were half as nice, your songs and you could sacrifice virgins too</p><p>School flunky, pill junky<br/>But look at the accolades these skills brung me<br/>Full of myself, but still hungry<br/>I bully myself 'cause I make me do what I put my mind to<br/>And I'm a million leagues above you, ill when I speak in tongues<br/>But it's still tongue and cheek, fuck you<br/>I'm drunk so Satan take the fucking wheel, I'm asleep in the front seat<br/>Bumping Heavy D. & the Boys, still chunky, but funky<br/>But in my head there's something I can feel tugging and struggling<br/>Angels fight with devils and here's what they want from me</p><p>They asking me to eliminate some of the women hate<br/>But if you take into consideration the bitter hatred that I had<br/>Then you may be a little patient and more sympathetic to the situation<br/>And understand the discrimination</p><p>But fuck it, life's handing you lemons, make lemonade then<br/>But if I can't batter the women how the fuck am I supposed to bake them a cake then?<br/>Don't mistake it for Satan<br/>It's a fatal mistake if you think I need to be overseas<br/>And take a vacation to trip a broad<br/>And make her fall on her face and don't be a retard<br/>Be a king? Think not<br/>Why be a king when you can be a God?</p></article></div>
