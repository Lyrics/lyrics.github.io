<title>Electric Youth â€“ Right Back to You | Lyrics</title>
<meta name="description" content="I turn the light on, and see your pretty face / I turn the light off, wishing that I could free space / I turn away, and know you're never far away from me / So I stay for another day / If there's a way, I'm coming right back to you / No matter what day, I'm coming right back to you / If there's a way, I'm coming right back to you / No matter what they say, I'm coming right back to you / I learn to run off so I can keep the pace / And never a moment goes by I wouldn't trade for your embrace / Skies of gray, I know you're never far away from me / And I stay for another day / If there's a way, I'm coming right back to you / No matter what day, I'm coming right back to you / If there's a way, I'm coming right back to you / No matter what they say, I'm coming right back to you / Won't you stay with me? / Won't you stay with me? / If there's a way, I'm coming right back to you / No matter what day, I'm coming right back to you / If there's a way, I'm coming right back to you / No matter what they say, I'm coming right back to you / If there's a way, (stay with me) I'm coming right back to you / No matter what day, (stay with me) I'm coming right back to you / No matter which way, (stay with me) I'm coming right back to you / If there's a way, (stay with me) I'm coming right back to you / If there's a way, (stay with me) I'm coming right back to you / No matter what day, (stay with me) I'm coming right back to you / No matter which way, (stay with me) I'm coming right back to you / If there's a way, (stay with me) I'm coming right back to you / _____________ / Name Right Back to You / Artist Electric Youth / Year 2011 / MusicBrainz ID 9dd15d43-a5d4-4a16-ad0d-9da2f2833f63"/>
