<title>Ed Sheeran â€“ One | Lyrics</title>
<meta name="description" content="Tell me that you turned down the man / Who asked for your hand / 'Cause you're waiting for me / And I know, you're gonna be away a while / But I've got no plans at all to leave / And would you take away my hopes and dreams? / Just stay with me / All my senses come to life / While I'm stumbling home as drunk as I / Have ever been and I'll never leave again / 'Cause you are the only one / And all my friends have gone to find / Another place to let their hearts collide / Just promise me, you'll always be a friend / 'Cause you are the only one / Take my hand and my / Heart and soul, I will / Only have these eyes for you / And you know, everything changes but / We'll be strangers if, we see this through / You could stay within these walls and bleed / But just stay with me / All my senses come to life / While I'm stumbling home as drunk as I / Have ever been and I'll never leave again / 'Cause you are the only one / And all my friends have gone to find / Another place to let their hearts collide / Just promise me, you'll always be a friend / 'Cause you are the only one / I'm stumbling off drunk, getting myself lost / I am so gone, so tell me the way home / I listen to sad songs, singing about love / And where it goes wrong / All my senses come to life / While I'm stumbling home as drunk as I / Have ever been and I'll never leave again / 'Cause you are the only one / And all my friends have gone to find / Another place to let their hearts collide / Just promise me, you'll always be a friend / 'Cause you are the only one / _________ / Name One / Artist Ed Sheeran / Album x"/>
