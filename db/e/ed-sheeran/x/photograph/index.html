<title>Ed Sheeran â€“ Photograph | Lyrics</title>
<meta name="description" content="Loving can hurt, loving can hurt sometimes / But it's the only thing that I know / When it gets hard, you know it can get hard sometimes / It is the only thing that makes us feel alive / We keep this love in a photograph / We made these memories for ourselves / Where our eyes are never closing / Our hearts are never broken / And time's forever frozen still / So you can keep me / Inside the pocket of your ripped jeans / Holding me close until our eyes meet / You won't ever be alone, wait for me to come home / Loving can heal, loving can mend your soul / And it's the only thing that I know / I swear it will get easier, remember that with every piece of you, / And it's the only thing we take with us when we die / We keep this love in a photograph / We made these memories for ourselves / Where our eyes are never closing / Our hearts were never broken / And time's forever frozen still / So you can keep me / Inside the pocket of your ripped jeans / Holding me close until our eyes meet / You won't ever be alone / And if you hurt me / That's okay baby, only words bleed / Inside these pages you just hold me / And I won't ever let you go / Wait for me to come home / Wait for me to come home / Wait for me to come home / Wait for me to come home / Oh you can fit me / Inside the necklace you got when you were sixteen / Next to your heartbeat where I should be / Keep it deep within your soul / And if you hurt me / That's okay baby, only words bleed / Inside these pages you just hold me / And I won't ever let you go / When I'm away, I will remember how you kissed me / Under the lamppost back on Sixth Street / Hearing you whisper through the phone / Wait for me to come home / ________________ / Name Photograph / Artist Ed Sheeran / Album x"/>
