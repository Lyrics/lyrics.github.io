Ooh I'm a mess right now
Inside out
Searching for a sweet surrender
But this is not he end
I can't work it out
How?
Going through the motions
Going through us
And though I've known it for the longest time
And all my hope
All my words are all over written on the signs
But you're my road walking me home
Home, home

See the flames inside my eyes
It burns so bright I wanna feel your love
Easy baby maybe I'm a light
Before tonight I wanna fall in love
And put your faith in my stomach

A mess of this time
Late last night
Drinking to suppress devotion
With fingers intertwined
I can't shake this feeling now
We're going through the motions
Hoping it stops
And though I've only caused you pain
You know with all of my words
With all this beloved
Although all the lies spoke
When you're my road walking me home
Home, home, home

See the flames inside my eyes
It burns so bright I wanna feel your love
Easy baby maybe I'm a light
Before tonight I wanna fall in love
And put your faith in my stomach

And for how long I've loved my lover
For how long I've loved my lover
And now, for how long, long I've loved my lover
Now, now, for how long, long I've loved my lover
Now now, for how long, long I've loved my lover
(And I feel loved)
For how long, long I've loved my lover
For how long, long I've loved my lover
Feel it all over now
For how long, long I've loved my lover
Now, now, for how long, long I've loved my lover
Feel it all over now
For how long I've loved my lover
Now now
For how long, long I've loved my lover
