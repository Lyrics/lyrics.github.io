<title>Ed Sheeran â€“ Don't | Lyrics</title>
<meta name="description" content="I met this girl late last year / She said "Don't you worry if I disappear" / I told her "I'm not really looking for another mistake" / I called an old friend thinking that the trouble would wait / But then I jumped right in a week later, returned / I reckon she was only looking for a lover to burn / But I gave her my time for two or three nights / Then I put it on pause until the moment was right / I went away four months until our paths crossed again / She told me "I was never looking for a friend / Maybe you could swing by my room around ten / Baby, bring the lemon and a bottle of gin / We'll be in between the sheets till the late AM" / Baby, if you wanted me then should have just said, she's singing / Don't fuck with my love / That heart is so cold / All over my arm / I don't wanna know that, babe / Don't fuck with my love / I told her she knows / Take aim and reload / I don't wanna know that, babe / For a couple weeks I only wanna see her / We drink away the days with a takeaway pizza / Before a text message was the only way to reach her / Now she's staying at my place and loves the way I treat her / Singing out Aretha, all over the track like a feature / And never wants to sleep, I guess that I don't want to either / But me and her, we make money the same way / Four cities, two planes, the same day / And those shows have never been what it's about / But maybe we'll go together and just figure it out / I'd rather put on a film with you and sit on a couch / But we should get on a plane or we'll be missing it now / Wish I'd have written it down, the way that things played out / But she was kissing him, how? I was confused about / She should figure it out, while I'm sat here singing / Don't fuck with my love / That heart is so cold / All over my arm / I don't wanna know that, babe / Don't fuck with my love / I told her she knows / Take aim and reload / I don't wanna know that, babe / *Knock knock knock* on my hotel door / I don't even know if she knows what for / She was crying on my shoulder, but I already told ya / Trust and respect is what we do this for / I never intended to be next / But you didn't need to take him to bed, that's all / And I never saw him as a threat / Until you disappeared with him to have sex, of course / It's not like we were both on tour / We were staying on the same fucking hotel floor / And I wasn't looking for a promise or commitment / But it was never just fun, and I thought you were different / This is not the way you realized what you wanted / It's a bit too much, too late if I'm honest / All this time, God knows I'm singing / Don't fuck with my love / That heart is so cold / All over my arm / I don't wanna know that, babe / Don't fuck with my love / I told her she knows / Take aim and reload / I don't wanna know that, babe / Don't fuck with my love / That heart is so cold / All over my arm / I don't wanna know that, babe / Don't fuck with my love / I told her she knows / Take aim and reload / I don't wanna know that, babe / ___________ / Name Don't / Artist Ed Sheeran / Album x"/>
