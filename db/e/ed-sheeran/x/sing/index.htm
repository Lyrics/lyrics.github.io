<div><pre>It's late in the evening
Glass on the side
I've been sat with you
For most of the night
Ignoring everybody here
We wish they would disappear
So maybe we could get down now
I don't wanna know
If you're getting ahead of the program
I want you to be mine, lady
To hold your body close
Take another step into the no man's land
For the longest time lady

I need you darling
Come on set the tone
If you feel you're falling
Won't you let me know
If you love me come on get involved
Feel it rushing through you from your head to toe

Sing
Louder
Sing

This love is ablaze
I saw flames from the side of the stage
And the fire brigade comes in a couple of days
Until then we got nothing to say and nothing to know
But something to drink and maybe something to smoke
Let it go until our roads are changed
Singing "We Found Love" in a local rave, no
I don't really know what I'm supposed to say
But I can just figure it out and hope and pray
I told her my name and said "it's nice to meet ya"
Then she handed me of a bottle of water filled with tequila
I already know if she's a keeper
Just from this one small act of kindness
I'm in deep if anybody finds out
I'm meant to drive home but I drunk all of it down
Not sober enough we just sit on the couch
One thing led to another now she's kissing my mouth

I need you darling
Come on set the tone
If you feel you're falling
Won't you let me know
If you love me come on get involved
Feel it rushing through you from your head to toe

Sing
Louder
Sing

Can you feel it?
All the guys in here don't even wanna dance
Can you feel it?
All that I can hear is music from the back
Can you feel it?
Found you hiding here so I hoped you'd take my hand darling

Before the beats kicks in again
Can you feel it?
Can you feel it?

I need you darling
Come on set the tone
If you feel you're falling
Won't you let me know
If you love me come on get involved
Feel it rushing through you from your head to toe

Sing</pre></div>
