(Victorious
by the good-force
vigorous, mighty
spirited)

From antumnos the life-giving winds
Fanned the flames into a blaze
The awen of the mighty

By the force of sucellus sledge
By every impact of ogmios club
With bricta's invincible epiphany

A tribe arose
A tribe broke forth

'Cause we're born free
'Cause we're born wild
'Cause we are indomitable and bold
'Cause we are fire (brave)
'Cause we are wave (strong)
'Cause we are rock (tribe)
We are one - we are helvetios

The ears tethered to the divine tongue
Following the ancient wise
As laughter fills antumnos

Drinking from the cup of life
The well that's never running dry
We wandered into the light of day

Again taranis enthean wheel revolved
From antumnos life was upheaved

By the force of succellus sledge
By every impact of ogmios' club
With bricta's invincible epiphany
