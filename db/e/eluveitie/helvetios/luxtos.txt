At the rise of a new dawn
Rose the children of the sun
To inhabit a kingdom
Augustly crowned in rock mass vast

All lakes are sanctuaries
Like covert nemetons
All forests are hallowed
Blest groves of an invictus tribe

Nertom woloutom que  (We are strong and we are rich)
Etsi snis karamos-e  (And we gladly are)

Nertom woloutom que etsi snis  (We are strong and we are rich)
Emmos snis riyi emmos snis  (We are free, that's what we are)
Widomor-e Karamos-e  (We know it and we love to know it)
Emmos snis riyi emmos snis andometi  (We are free and we are untamed)
Nertom woloutom que etsi snis  (We are strong and we are rich)
Emmos snis riyi emmos snis  (We are free, that's what we are)

A kingly tribe sublime
Arose in its golden time
In a prosperous era
The age primordial reign

A horde of untameables
Invincible armada
A dashing bold host
Of venturous fearnaughts
