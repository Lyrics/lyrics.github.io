Our estates are under fire
Our villagers fall prey to pillage
How can we stay on the sideline
How long will we take this lying down?
Refuse to quell the anger
Time has come to take up arms again
The last call to rise up

Bestir
This is the flash of our last hope
Will you ally with us?
Wake up - open your eyes
Reach out
And seize this golden venture
We've lost ourselves in strife
While the raptor unopposedly
claws at Gallia's free lands
We have to call a halt this
Unite the tribes and rise
Take a look around yourself
And see this time is ours
The last call to rise up

Our lands are under fire
Our villagers fall prey to pillage
How can we stay on the sideline
How long will we take this lying down?
It is time to join forces
Let the eagles beak burst on our shields
Unite! This is Gallia uprising!
