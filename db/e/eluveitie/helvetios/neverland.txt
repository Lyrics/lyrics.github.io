Behold this Proud
Crestfallen Parade

Dead Bodies towered up like this dividing Rampart
The Hopes of yesterday forgotten and interred
Burnt to the Ground

Lacerate my Neverland blood
My Otherworld elapsed
My silver Lining

Another false Dawn collapsed
A Glimpse of our safe Home
Perished in Bibracte

Another Hope dearly prayed
When we all were betrayed
The End of our Exodus

Behold this egregious Mockery
We refused to bow down
Our own goddamn Blood was the Price we had to pay
Santones Land Land we never got to see

When the Fiends come marching in...
