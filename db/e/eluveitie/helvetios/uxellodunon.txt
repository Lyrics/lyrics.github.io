This is the final resistance
This was the final revolt

In desperate hope
With tear-dimmed eyes
With wrath-torn minds
We took up arms one more time

Uxellodunon
Oh the last stand
The freedom manifesto

We will never forget
The things we've seen
The deaths we died
The tears we cried
We will never regret
We defied
We will raise our arm stubs in pride
We will never perish

Our cut off hands
Proclaimed grandeur
Land can be taken but
Dignity's impregnable

Uxellodunon
Fortress of free men
Shining beacon of indomitably

Bearing witness of freedom
Bearing witness of our names,
Cause we will never...

Out from the ashes
Out from the graves
The offspring of antumnos
Will arise to life again

Uxellodunon
Oh the last stand the freedom manifesto
