    <div class="view"><pre>There at these ominous shores of river Saone
There at these shores the die has been cast
Valour and honour were stripped off their meaning
We will not know innocence again

At sombre nightfall the defenceless were bestially run down
Saone stained with helvetic blood
You will not shake hands with arrant beliers
You'd rather die than turn into minions

Freedom was our highest good
We ventured our lives
Meet the liar
This dead black night
Our destiny revealed
Meet the enemy
It will... never be the same

There at these portentous shores of river Saone
There at these shores the die has been cast
We saw the true face of the Roman ravener
The gorgoneion on the cuirass appeared

It was like playing ludus latrunculorum
The pieces were made of flesh and of blood
Valour and honour bereft of their meaning
The blood on your hands will forever stay

Freedom was our highest good
We ventured our lives
Meet the liar
This dead black night
Our destiny revealed
Meet the enemy
It will... never be the same

It's not us to go under the yoke
Of that fact the Roman people are witness
We will not bow (meet the liar)
Meet the enemy
Meet the liar
Meet the enemy</pre></div>
