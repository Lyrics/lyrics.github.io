We set forth, a retinue with steed and cart
So we roved the land stealthily
We sallied out to find new shores
As the passage led

Set sail, ye hearts into the sea of hope
The druid blessed this mount foreseen
We grudged no pains, we faced distress
Yet a glowing wick kindles fire...

Alike, a liminal place, a dormant beacon we faced
The haven foretold a fortress of ages to come
At the rise of a new dawn, woke the daughter of the sun
Wafted on black wings, vastly soaring boding skies

We followed the rites of old
As we took out the ordained new land
We held our breath as the skies got black
And a storm arose, a swarm of crows

Lo and behold! The black birds branched out
A circle wide in the riven skies
They lined the nemeton of the fulgent hill
And again, and again, and again the presage witnessed

Adiantunne ni exverti
Adiantunne ni nappisetu
