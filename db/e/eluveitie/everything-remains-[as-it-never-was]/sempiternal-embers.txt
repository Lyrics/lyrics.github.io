Glowing and blazing in the wind of times
Ever lit, searching and fathoming
The fire's arcane consuming flames
Sparks to imbue our very souls

Pervading the very breath of life
Flickering from the depths of eternity

Never asleep, never extinct
Not ever ceasing to gleam
Never sear the sempiternal embers
Never profaned, never fail
Not ever ceasing to refine
Never forfeit, never faint
The sempiternal embers

The essence of being, the form of existance
Forever inflamed with passion, heart of hearts
Burning so bright, yet clandestine

Gleaming in the lair of the powers to be
The four mighty ones the high kings concealed

Giving birth to the glimmer within
Incessantly fostering the flames...

Glowing and blazing in the wind of times
Ever lit, searching and fathoming
Sparks to imbue our very souls
