I've been fire, fed by the four winds
I've been water in the stream
And a drop of dew on the culm
I've been clay in the hands of a potter
I've been rosin of a tree
And a leaf, by the breeze carried away

I've been a child of seven spirits
I've been an eagle in the skies
And the swashing fish in the lough fulgent
I've been star in the loosing sky
I've been a tear in the wind
And a word within paean

I've been a flower on the green pasture
I've been the song of a bird
And the vast roar of a bear
I am a lump of this vivid soil
I'm the brother of the trees
a chthonian lot of this earth

Breathe this dream, and let your soul inhale it!
Bare and naked, let us dance on the meadows

Revel within this nature which we're all a part of. Free this wolf forever!
Free this child! Indui uelui cantla canamos.
