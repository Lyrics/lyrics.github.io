...the endless knot .... the holy grove...
...the threshold ... the place beyond...
...I enter, like a newborn child....

Embracing the eternal
Like a consuming fire
the knowledge grows
when it's cleft
Though still patchworked
yet flooding
the creating touch
washing away the vile.

Embracing the ancient
while trees gently whisper
those intimate
longed-for words
The greet wheel
is still revolving
with untouchable sovereignty
so invulnerable.

Into the sacred grove I drown
The endless knot
draws me into
the fire of hearts, the place beyond
Then I'll be born
then I'll be renewed

...naked spirit ... bare...
spirit
