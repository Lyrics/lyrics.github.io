A nexus fruition
Whirling cognition
Ulterior, the failing of words

A pageant to leave me bewildered
Lurch at the sight of the clandestine ascendancy
Pervading anima
An awe-struck principle, an adytum to find our home

Long for the rapture again
Crave for the pristine light

Vastness engulfing the soul
Unfurling this truth, an orbit in sovereignty
Sown into deep darkness
The grain has to die, perish to bestow new life

A vis major painting a rapturous view
Heralding a vivid thema

Heed, it's like calling the rain
It's like bearing in pain
Like embracing life and decaying in death
Heed, it's like calling the rain
It's like the caress of a mother
Like life to go withered, a perennial pneuma
I will not forget what I arose from

Decidual, the forests proclaim
The glory primal, the rapturous supremacy
Vanquishing the vile
Burgeoning beyond, bearing the essence of life

Crave for the rapture again
Long for the pristine light
