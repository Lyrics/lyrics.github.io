In a virgin world primeval
A newborn bullcalf emerged
Wonderous and celestial
Three cranes to be its witness and droves
Its honour mantled the face of the earth

A blessing unleashed to the earth
Unseathed the embodiment of life

Tarvos - The embodiment of life
Tarvos - The genesis of time

The earthly heathlands roamed by Esus
Questing condigh sacrifice
A divine yearning hushed by the prodigy
Three cranes to wake the slumbering taur
To warn him 'gainst the imminence of a huntergod ravenous

"A drawn struggle through innominate days
As utimately the sword of Esus
Pierced the bull's heart
Three cranes to lament as its blood laves
Creation wept under an eclipsing sun
As gloom descended upon world
Three cranes to catch a drop of blood
And leave far away..."

A blessing depraved from the world
As snow fell for the first time on earth

Three cranes returned
Pouring out the blood
To the ground of Tarvos' death
And out of nothing
The soil scarified, the divine bull was reborn
Under a newborn sun nature rejoiced
Thus spring came back to earth
Overcame the brumal reigh
Though Esus came back
To fell the bull, the eternal cycle has begun

Tarvos - Will always be slain
Tarvos - Ever to be reborn again
