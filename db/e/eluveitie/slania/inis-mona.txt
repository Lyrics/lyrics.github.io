Welcome to the land of questions
Welcome to the isle of lore
Where the veil came crumbling down

There it all began,
The germination
Unveiling a cryptic door
There it was revealed
Hopes and aspirations
Unclosing an enthralled door

Escalate the sense
Enhancing to join the dawn

I close my eyes, Inis Mona
And reminisce of those palmy days
I moon o'er you, Inis Mona
As long as I breathe
I'll call you my home

20 years I have walked your barrows
Years of emulous youth
I followed the path of the wise

There it all was sown,
The Inspiration
Removing the seven seals
There it was revealed
Enigma and freedom
Unclosing an unseen door
