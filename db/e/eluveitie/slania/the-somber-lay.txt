A murky presage roaming the land
To silence the skylark's chant
The somber kiss is at end
To impart the crimson robe

Heed the darksome maid
Dancing across this equinox
To relegate persistence
As the bleak darkness grows

A cryptal impellent, devoted to the sublime round

Beholden for the boons of light
Retreating into quietness
We harken the somber lay
We sing the somber lay

Close your eyes and heed and vide,
Then you shall see
The sphere revolves as it's promised

Flames flickering deftly
To banish the nipping air
The dark time is at hand
Lighted by bardic chant

Heed the darksome maid
To enwrap all in bleakness
A dark veil o'silence
As quiet insight buds

Darkness roaming the land
Long dead the skylark's chant
The dark vis usurped command
To impart the sallow robe

Sure a new light will come
The lifewheel is rotating onward
Given is the promise
Thus assertive we wear on

Life-given impellent, devoted to the sublime round
