We wandered led by the gods, you gave a voice
Uîdluiā of the Allobroges
Your feet danced in the footprints of the Otherworld
The words of your songs carved into our hearts

My Vianna, my bright light
Vianna, my Sacrifice
My Vianna, my patroness
Vianna, my Immortal
Hallowed be Thy name, my child

Dancing in the Awen, you became the word
As tears mingled with the Rhodanos
And as the earth opened up to receive its sacrifice
You blessed the fen, the consecrated ground

My Vianna, my bright light
Vianna, my Sacrifice
My Vianna, my patroness
Vianna, my Immortal
My Vianna, my bright light
Vianna, my Sacrifice
My Vianna, my patroness
Vianna, my Immortal
Hallowed be Thy name, my child
