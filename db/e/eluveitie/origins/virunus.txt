North of the yew grove, one mountain was crowned in glory and steel
Shining beacon of wealth, home of the prosperous High Princess of Noreia

One man to fight on the blood-red mountainside
One man to vanquish the rapacious beast

One fateful day it appeared, that colossal and furious boar
To feed on our sacred lands, a swath of destruction was all that remained
Iron swords were raised in vain
Asunder burst our lightning spears
Oppressed and stricken we languished in fear, until he rose

One man to fight on the blood-red mountainside
One man to vanquish the rapacious beast
One man to end the age of distress
One man to fulfill the prophecy enthean

Vir, Vir, Vir, Vir
Vir, Vir, Vir, Vir

North of the yew grove, one man stepped forth to challenge the beast
The father of this town, home of the prosperous high Princess of Noreia

One man to fight on the blood-red mountainside
One man to vanquish the rapacious beast
One man to end the age of distress
One man to fulfill the prophecy enthean
