Imi gdonios riios rijiaspe toutias

 The mountains trembled
 When the Antumnos' doors opened wide
 The ancient one stepped forth
 To bring to justice the grim tyrants
 A withered-skinned old man
 Divine Logos upon him
 His words alike the arrows in his quiver

 We followed him
 Our ears tethered to the divine tongue
 The ancient wise of Antumnos

 Our burning strength - our beacon light - our freedom's drown

 On the day of strife
 Two daughters born in pain
 To the reign of life
 Their dawning glory will shine

 "Seseroneos! Ferocious giant o Tauriscus! You wroth bull
 Long enough have you trampled over these lands!"
 A raddled aged man
 Vanquished the oppressor
 And reclaimed the lands of the West

 Our salvation - our victory

 As our lands bloomed again
 And Celtos' children grew
 Ogmios returned to Antumnos
 To attend Gobanno's feast
