I, high king, sovereign and servant
Holder of divine, regality bestowed in the Omphalos grove
My kingship, the song of the gods
Thou shalt know me by my fruits, the abundance in which we grew
The signs and wonders at our feet, which the flight of the crows revealed

I am the crown of Gallia, I am the oak in the nemeton
I am the servant of Antumnos' children, I am the will of our gods
Ambicatus is my name

My chosen set forth to conquer, kindling beacons
My kingdom prospered and grew
Thou shalt know me by my fruits, from the Hercynan forests
To beyond the sky-scraping Alps, to which the flight of the crows led us

I am the crown of Gallia, I am the oak in the nemeton
I am the servant of Antumnos' children, I am the will of our gods

I am the crown of Gallia, I am the oak in the nemeton
I am the servant of Antumnos' children, I am the will of our gods
Ambicatus is my name
