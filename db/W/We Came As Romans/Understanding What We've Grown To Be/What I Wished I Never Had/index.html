    <div class="view"><pre>Don't catch me at the wrong time
Or you will feel my wrath
The one I wished I never had.

I need to rid myself of resentment
And every last bit of it
If I'm going to live up to the things I've written
I need to clear my mind of this anger
And all the rage that I've held near
If I'm going to live up to the words I've spoken.

But I haven't yet,
Letting go is how I can start to fight my way
Out of this trench I've dug
In this war against myself
But I haven't yet.

Don't catch me at the wrong time
Or you will feel my wrath
The one I wished I never had.

I wish I never had this demon inside
I wish I knew how to cast it out
I wish I never had this demon inside
I wish I knew how to cast it out
But I fear it will never leave me. x2

I need to rid myself of resentment
And every last bit of it
If I'm going to live up to the things I've written
I need to clear my mind of this anger
And all the rage that I've held near
If I'm going to live up to the words I've spoken.

Letting go, just let it go
I know. x2

I know I need to let go
Of everything that has
Ever made me think of myself better
I'm not better than anyone else
Of anything that's filled me with anger
That I have taken out on everyone else.

These demons will never leave me
I can only find ways to not let them out
These demons will never leave me
But I control them
Not the other way around.</pre></div>
