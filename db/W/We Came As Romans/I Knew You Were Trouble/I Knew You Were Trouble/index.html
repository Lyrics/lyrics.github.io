<br/><span></span>I was in your sights, you got me alone
<br/><span></span>You found me, you found me, you found me<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>I guess you didn't care and I guess I liked that
<br/><span></span>And when I fell hard, you took a step back
<br/><span></span>Without me, without me, without me<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>And she's long gone when she's next to me
<br/><span></span>And I realize the blame is on me<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>'Cause I knew you were trouble when you walked in
<br/><span></span>So shame on me now
<br/><span></span>Flew me to places I'd never been
<br/><span></span>Till you put me down, oh
<br/><span></span>I knew you were trouble when you walked in
<br/><span></span>So shame on me now
<br/><span></span>Flew me to places I'd never been
<br/><span></span>Now I'm lying on the cold hard ground<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>Oh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble
<br/><span></span>Oh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>No apologies, she'll never see you cry
<br/><span></span>Pretend she doesn't know that she's the reason why
<br/><span></span>You're drowning, you're drowning, you're drowning<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>And I heard you moved on from whispers on the street
<br/><span></span>A new notch in your belt is all I'll ever be
<br/><span></span>And now I see, now I see, now I see<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>She was long gone when she met me
<br/><span></span>And I realize the joke is on me, yeah!<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>I knew you were trouble when you walked in
<br/><span></span>So shame on me now

<br/><span></span>Oh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>And the saddest fear comes creeping in
<br/><span></span>That you never loved me or him or anyone or anything
<br/><span></span>Yeah...<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>I knew you were trouble when you walked in
