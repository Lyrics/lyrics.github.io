    <div class="view"><pre>Christ, he didn't know, he was condemned
Christ, he didn't know, with God's intend
Christ, he didn't know, he had the will
Christ, he didn't know, he saw the hill

Golgotha, they all knew Golgotha
Golgotha, they all knew Golgotha
Golgotha, they all knew Golgotha
Golgotha, they all knew Golgotha

Christ had died at last, he gave the most
Christ had died at last, the holy ghost
Christ had died at last, he had the will
Christ had died at last, he saw the hill

Golgotha, they all knew Golgotha
Golgotha, they all knew Golgotha
Golgotha, they all...

Oh Christ, oh Christ, you were condemned
To die on Roman's cross at end
Pilatus he had not the will
To send the right man to the hill
So he was nailed like ugly scum
To trunks of shame the carpenters done
And he screamed out "I had the will,
But father left me on the hill"

Golgotha, they all knew Golgotha
Golgotha, they all knew Golgotha

Oh Christ, you are a lunatic
Oh Christ, you're just a lunatic
Go on, scream out you had the will
To die for us upon the hill

Golgotha
Golgotha

Golgotha, they all knew Golgotha
Golgotha, they all knew Golgotha

Golgotha, they all knew Golgotha
Golgotha, they all knew Golgotha

They all knew Golgotha
They all knew Golgotha
They all knew Golgotha
They all knew Golgotha</pre></div>
