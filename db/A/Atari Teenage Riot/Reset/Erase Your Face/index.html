<title>Atari Teenage Riot – Erase Your Face | Lyrics</title>
<meta name="description" content="Erase your face / I get out of the house and walk towards the station / It&#x27;s dark, deserted, I&#x27;m feeling lonely but connected / Every move is being recorded and I know it / But my anger is a gift / And my biggest secret"/>
