    <div class="view"><pre>What'd you expect from me?
It's not my fault you'll never be happy
Just 'cause you're right doesn't mean I'm wrong
Our days were numbered and we knew it all along
Can't you let things be?
Now all that's left is misunderstandings
Spent my nights wishing I was gone
My dad was right, we will never get along

So I'm done, 'cause things could never be the same
This is the last time, this is the last time you'll ever burden me

I can't believe you got the best of me
I can't believe I trusted every word you said
Stretched myself out way too far
Now I can see you for who you are

I can't believe you got the best of me
I can't believe I trusted every word you said
It's all finally making sense
You took what's left of my innocence, oh no
I can't believe you got the best of me

Can't you act your age?
Is it that hard to say what you're thinking?
Lately my life's moving way too fast
You'd drag me down if I'd let you hold me back
What a mess you've made
And you hide from it at the bars you frequent
Blamed myself avoiding time this cost
But looking back you only learn from what you lost

So I'm done, cause things could never be the same
This is the last time, this is the last time you'll ever burden me

I can't believe you got the best of me
I can't believe I trusted every word you said
Stretched myself out way too far
Now I can see you for who you are
I can't believe you got the best of me
I can't believe I trusted every word you said
It's all finally making sense
You took what's left of my innocence, oh no
I can't believe you got the best of me
I can't believe you got the best of me

I will never be the one you want, no I will never be the one you want
(Oh-oh oh-oh)
Finally come to terms that I can't stop, no not this time
(Ye-yeah)

I will never be the one you want, no I will never be the one you want
(Oh-oh oh-oh)
Finally come to terms that I can't stop, no not this time
(Ye-yeah)

I can't believe you got the best of me
I can't believe I trusted every word you said
Stretched myself out way too far
Now I can see you for who you are
I can't believe you got the best of me
I can't believe I trusted every word you said
It's all finally making sense
You took what's left of my innocence, oh no
I can't believe you got the best of me
I can't believe you got the best of me</pre></div>
