    <div class="view"><pre>When the curtain falls it rolls, unwraps, reminds me
The person that I am
I'm still afraid, ashamed, of what's behind me
But you gave me the strength to stand

Sh-sh-sh-shake it off go get the things you want
I'll bottle the shame (bottle the shame)
Just sh-sh-shake it off, and no one will ever know (won't know)

I'm a slave to all these voices in my head
And I'm afraid, I'm afraid of what they've said
I'm a slave

Sometimes when no one's left to listen I'll sit and argue with myself
Say all the things I wish to tell you, without hurting someone else
Sh-sh-sh-shake it off go get the things you want
I'll bottle the shame (bottle the shame)
Just sh-sh-shake it off, and no one will ever know (won't know)

I'm a slave to all these voices in my head
And I'm afraid, I'm afraid of what they've said
I'm a slave to all these voices in my head
And I'm afraid they'll walk with me until my end

Hey you, when'd ya get so cold? (When'd ya get so cold?)
Hey you, just do what you're told, do what you're told
Hey you, you're gonna be a star
As long as you'll let us we'll make you the person that you aren't

I'm a slave to all these voices in my head
And I'm afraid, I'm afraid of what they've said
I'm a slave (I'm a slave) to all these voices in my head
And I'm afraid (I'm afraid) they'll walk with me until my end

Sh-sh-sh-shake it off go get the things you want
I'll bottle the shame (bottle the shame)</pre></div>
