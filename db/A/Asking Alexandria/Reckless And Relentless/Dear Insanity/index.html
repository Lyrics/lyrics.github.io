    <div class="view"><pre>Oh, sweet insanity
You take my hand and walk me out into the dark
We walk this road for hours and hours
To the white hills and the oceans

On a collision course, to hell we march
We're doomed to this now
Oh, the irony
If I'm going down I won't go down alone
You're doomed to this one
You're doomed to
You're doomed to this now
You're doomed to

Hold your breath my dear
We're going under, we're going under

Hold your breath my dear
We're going under, we're going under

I've walked this road for hours
To the white hills and the oceans
I search for solace in this toxic land of sin
Just let me in
Don't wake me up, their songs are soothing
Their wine subdues me

Hold your breath my dear
We're going under, we're going under

Hold your breath my dear
We're going under, we're going under

Dreams, my mind won't me lift from my dreams
And though I tried I can't escape my mind
Dreams, my mind won't lift me from my dreams
And though you try you can't escape me

Now you've seen what I've become
Now you've seen what I can do
Now you've seen what I'm capable of

I've walk this road for hours
To the white hills and the oceans
I search for solace in this toxic land of sin
Just let me in
Don't wake me up, their songs are soothing
Their wine subdues me

Welcome to the diary of a man that lost his mind so long ago
Welcome to the shell of a man with a heart so black and cold

Over and over in my head</pre></div>
