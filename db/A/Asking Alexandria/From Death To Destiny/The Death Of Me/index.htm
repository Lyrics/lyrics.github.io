    <div class="view"><pre>Am I insane? I ask myself over and over and over again
Flies in my brain pouring out from the cracks in my skull
Am I alone? Surrounded by sin and I think I might just be suffocating
The devil came to take me to hell but I'm already there

Am I insane? Am I insane? Am I insane?
The devil came to take me to hell but I'm already there

I won't let you be the death of me
No, I refuse to let you bring me down, bring me down
I won't let you make me out to be the one who's in the wrong
I know I've lost my mind before but now I'm back and I'm better than ever

Am I insane? I fold myself over and scream 'til I'm spitting blood
Flies in my brain the itching is incomprehensible and it won't stop
Am I alone? The voices grow fainted but they just won't fucking go away
The devil came to take me to hell but I'm already there

Am I insane? Am I insane? Am I insane?
Am I alone? Surrounded by death, I think this might just be the end
Am I insane? Am I insane? Am I insane?
The devil came to take me to hell but I'm already there

You can't take this away from me, you can't relieve these demons
You can't make this okay for me, you're the ones who caused these feelings
I apologize for what I'm about to do
I tried to sympathize but at the end of the day you brought this on yourselves

I won't let you be the death of me
No, I refuse to let you bring me down, bring me down
I won't let you make me out to be the one who's in the wrong
I know I've lost my mind before but now I'm back and I'm better than ever

The tears have left a blur that I can't explain
The pain has left a hole in which my heart should have been
I'm blind with rage and I can't shake this feelings
Irrational, impetuous, intemperate

I won't let you be the death of me
I refuse to let you bring me down, bring me down
I won't let you make me out to be the one who's in the wrong
I know I've lost my mind before but now I'm back and I'm better than ever</pre></div>
