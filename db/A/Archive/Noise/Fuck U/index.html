<br/><span></span>See the sin in your grin and the shape of your mouth
<br/><span></span>All I want is to see you in terrible pain
<br/><span></span>Though we won't ever meet I remember your name<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>Can't believe you were once just like anyone else
<br/><span></span>Then you grew and became like the devil himself
<br/><span></span>Pray to God I think of a nice thing to say
<br/><span></span>But I don't think I can so fuck you anyway<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>You are scum, you are scum and I hope that you know
<br/><span></span>That the cracks in your smile are beginning to show
<br/><span></span>Now the world needs to see that it's time you should go
<br/><span></span>There's no light in your eyes and your brain is too slow<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>Can't believe you were once just like anyone else
<br/><span></span>Then you grew and became like the devil himself
<br/><span></span>Pray to God I can think of a nice thing to say
<br/><span></span>But I don't think I can, so fuck you anyway<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>Bet you sleep like a child with your thumb in your mouth
<br/><span></span>I could creep up beside put a gun in your mouth
<br/><span></span>Makes me sick when I hear all the shit that you say
<br/><span></span>So much crap coming out, it must take you all day<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>There's a space kept in hell with your name on the seat
<br/><span></span>With a spike in the chair just to make it complete
<br/><span></span>When you look at yourself do you see what I see
<br/><span></span>If you do why the fuck are you looking at me?
<br/><span></span>Why the fuck are you looking at me?
<br/><span></span>Why the fuck are you looking at me?
<br/><span></span>Why the fuck, why the fuck are you looking at me?
<br/><span></span>Why the fuck, why the fuck are you looking at me?<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>There's a time for us all and I think yours has been
<br/><span></span>Can you please hurry up 'cause I find you obscene
<br/><span></span>We can't wait for the day that you're never around
<br/><span></span>When that face isn't here and you rot underground<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>Can't believe you were once just like anyone else
<br/><span></span>Then you grew and became like the devil himself
<br/><span></span>Pray to god I can think of a nice thing to say
<br/><span></span>But I don't think I can so fuck you anyway<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>So fuck you anyway
