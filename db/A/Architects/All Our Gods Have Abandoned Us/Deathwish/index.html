    <div class="view"><pre>There was a time for change, I fear it came and went
Who's gonna pick up the pieces, who will be left to repent?
The sun is burnt out black
Now there's no turning back

Now there's no turning back

Yeah, I know you know that we've been living a lie
Turn a blind eye until the day we die
Maybe we've passed the point of no return
Maybe we just wanna watch the world burn
We just wanna watch the world burn

Our collapse will be remission
A planet scarred beyond all recognition
Suicide in slow motion, is this the path we have chosen?
Too cowardly to face this; we've got a fucking death wish

You want to play with fire? Don't cry when you get burnt
You gave us life, we gave back death in return
The sun is burnt out black
Now there's not turning back

We will consume until there's nothing left
Remember us as a waste of breath

Yeah, I know you know that we've been living a lie
Turn a blind eye until the day we die
Maybe we've passed the point of no return
Maybe we just wanna watch the world burn
We just wanna watch the world burn

I know you know that we've been living a lie
Maybe we've passed the point of no return
We just wanna watch the world burn

I want to believe that it all counts for something
The writing is on the wall
It's hard to accept that it was all for nothing
All for nothing

Yeah, I know you know that we've been living a lie
Turn a blind eye until the day we die
Maybe we've passed the point of no return
Maybe we just wanna watch the world burn
We just wanna watch the world burn</pre></div>
