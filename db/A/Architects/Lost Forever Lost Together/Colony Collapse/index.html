    <div class="view"><pre>Dear, oh dear...
What a sorry state we're in
We brought the battle, we saw the signs
We've found ourselves two steps behind

I'm counting days like they're running out
There's ghosts in the water, so prey for drought

This time there's nowhere to hide
We're facing the firing squad side by side

1986
This is full relapse
Our latest apocalypse
This is colony collapse

Give us the rope and we'll tie our own noose
We truly believed all we touched turned to gold
We were warned but we wouldn't be told

I'm counting days like they're running out
There's ghosts in the water, so prey for drought

This time there's nowhere to hide
We're facing the firing squad side by side

They said that the ocean's on fire
Say it isn't true...
The truth never hurt so much
Can we start anew?

1986
This is full relapse
Our latest apocalypse
This is colony collapse

They said that the ocean's on fire
Say it isn't true...
The truth never hurt so much
Can we start anew?

This time there's nowhere to hide
We're facing the firing squad side by side

They said that the ocean's on fire
Say it isn't true...
The truth never hurt so much
Can we start anew?

1986
This is full relapse
Our latest apocalypse
This is colony collapse</pre></div>
