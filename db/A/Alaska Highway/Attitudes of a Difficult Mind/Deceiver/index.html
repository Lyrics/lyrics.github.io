    <div class="view"><pre>Flies invade your spoiled words
Spoken once to comfort me
But in your game I was deceived
And now this question I ask of you...

Can you see me behind the lids which drape your eyes
Waiting for that moment when all you've worked for dies
In that place you call a heart can my answer dwell
Just utter the words to release me, deceiver
From this doubt infested cell

A contraption of seduction, you encouraged my fall
From the place that resisted you
And when I failed to ignore my heart
You exposed a wound and bled me through

(The rage inside is building now
To conquer the bringer of my fading world
Nothing can protect that slayer of love
For pain can ignite an apocalypse)

(Deceiver)
(Deceiver)

Flies invade your spoiled words
Spoken once to comfort me
But in your game I was deceived
And now this question I ask of you...

(Deceiver)

Can you see me behind the lids which drape your eyes
Waiting for that moment when all you've worked for dies
In that place you call a heart can my answer dwell
Just utter the words to release me, deceiver
From this doubt infested cell

Can you see me now behind the lids which drape your eyes
Waiting for that moment when all you've worked for dies

(Deceiver)
