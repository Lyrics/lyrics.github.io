    <div class="view"><pre>Dressed in rags
Plastic bags
I recognise you
I know you from before

Like slugs on their way
Across the deadly tar
Going for your dreams
Won't get you very far

And is it true?
Do saints have to end up like you?
She called you a liar
You dropped the hair dryer into the water

I thought we'd see
That sinners end up harmless like me
Running out of things to say
Running out of grounds to get up every day

The trick is to keep lying
Put on your brightest smile
Run towards the train
Play your final game

The trick is to keep lying
Put on your brightest smile
Run towards the train
Play your final game

I feel sleepy
This is creepy
My hands are numb
Pile the bottles up

In Babylon you smile
In Babylon you never reach the top

Is it true?
Do saints have to end up like you?
She called you a liar
You dropped the hair dryer into the water

I thought we'd see
That sinners end up harmless like me
Running out of things to say
Running out of grounds to get up every day

(The trick is to keep lying)
Is it true?
(Put on your brightest smile)
(Run towards the train)
Do saints have to end up like you?
(Play your final game)

(The trick is to keep lying)
She called you a liar
(Put on your brightest smile)
You dropped the hair dryer
(Run towards the train)
(Play your final game)
Into the water

(The trick is to keep lying)
I thought we'd see
(Put on your brightest smile)
(Run towards the train)
That sinners end up harmless like me
(Play your final game)
(The trick is to keep lying)
Running out of things to say
(Put on your brightest smile)
Running out of grounds to get up every day
(Run towards the train)
(Play your final game)

(Play your final game)</pre></div>
