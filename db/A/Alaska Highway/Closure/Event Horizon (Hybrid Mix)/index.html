    <div class="view"><pre>Outside you are flesh
Ain't perfect, so imperfect
Could you ever see
A reflection in XXX

Machine to this world
Getting you I belived
But by you I was deceived

In your hands I placed my heart
You could see what you couldn't feel
This was my fatal error
Loving something made from steel

In your hands I placed my heart
You could see what you couldn't feel
This was my fatal error
Loving something made from steel

Motion without erection
Hole became an infection
Exterminate me XXX
Place my mind to its rest

You'll be melted by the sun
But god reminds you I'm the one
Nothing to me
Just cold machinery

In your hands I placed my heart
You could see what you couldn't feel
This was my fatal error
Loving something made from steel

In your hands I placed my heart
You could see what you couldn't feel
This was my fatal error
Loving something made from steel

In your hands I placed my heart
You could see what you couldn't feel
This was my fatal error
Loving something made from steel

In your hands I placed my heart
You could see what you couldn't feel
This was my fatal error
Loving something made from steel

Made from steel</pre></div>
