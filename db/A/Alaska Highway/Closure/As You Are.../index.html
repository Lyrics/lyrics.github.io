    <div class="view"><pre>Why do you hide your eyes from me?
There is no shame in empathy

I'm not perfect, there's no explanation
I've not come for complication

Stakes are made so that we learned
lead our souls to

Why do you feel this way?

Have I failed you?
Have I lead you astray?
Have you invited darkness to your side?
No matter how you've tried to hide
I see and love you as you are

Why do you run from sadness?
It comes from someplace good
If you've never truly loved
Then you've never truly hurt
Does that make make you feel weak?
And have I crossed that line?

Have I failed you?
Have I lead you astray?
Have you invited darkness to your side?
No matter how you've tried to hide
I see and love you as you are

Do not hide your face from me
Tears are a sign of God's mercy
As you cry, so does he
I love you as you are...
