    <div class="view"><pre>Yeah

Shh, quiet, you might piss somebody off
Like me, motherfucker, you've been at it for too long
While you feed off others' insecurities
You stand in front of me and bite the hand that feeds

Self-righteousness is wearing thin
(Lies inside your head, your best friend)
Heart bleeds, but not for fellow men
(Broken glass, your fake reflection)

I've had enough, it's time for something real
Don't respect the words you're speaking
Gone too far, a clone

So how does it feel to know that someone's kid in the heart of America
Has blood on their hands, fighting to defend your rights
So you can maintain a lifestyle that insults his family's existence?
Well, where I'm from we have a special salute, we aim high in the air
Towards all the pompous assholes who spend their days pointing fingers
(Fuck you)

Shh, quiet, you might piss somebody off
Like the heartbeat of this country when antagonized too long
I'll be damned if you count me in as part of your generous hypocrisy
Collecting enemies

Tabloid gossip queen, worthless man
(There's no need for us to bury you)
Selfish agenda once again
(Right this way, you've dug your own grave)

I've had enough, it's time for something real
Don't respect the words you're speaking
Gone too far, a clone

All the way from the east to the west, we got this high society
Looking down on that very foundation, constantly reminding us that our actions
Are the cause of all their problems, pointing their fingers in every direction
Blaming their own nation for who wins elections
They've never contributed a fucking thing to the country they love to criticize

Excuse the obscene, ignore the untrue
Depictions we see, try and get through
Admitting mistakes can hurt
I'm not the last but I sure ain't the first

Shh, quiet, you might piss somebody off

Self-righteousness is wearing thin
(Lies inside your head your best friend)
Heart bleeds, but not for fellow men
(Broken glass your fake reflection)

I've had enough, it's time for something real
Don't respect the words you're speaking
Gone too far, a clone</pre></div>
