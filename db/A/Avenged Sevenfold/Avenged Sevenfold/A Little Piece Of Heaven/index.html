<br/><span></span>For me to take what's mine until the end of time?
<br/><span></span>We were more than friends before the story ends
<br/><span></span>And I will take what's mine, create what God would never design<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>Our love had been so strong for far too long
<br/><span></span>I was weak with fear that something would go wrong
<br/><span></span>Before the possibilities came true
<br/><span></span>I took all possibility from you.<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>I almost laughed myself to tears
<br/><span></span>Conjuring her deepest fears
<br/><span></span>(Come here, you fucking bitch)<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>Must have stabbed her fifty fucking times
<br/><span></span>I can't believe it
<br/><span></span>Ripped her heart out right before her eyes
<br/><span></span>Eyes over easy
<br/><span></span>Eat it, eat it, eat it<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>She was never this good in bed even when she was sleeping
<br/><span></span>Now she's just so perfect I've never been quite so fucking deep in<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>It goes on and on and on
<br/><span></span>And I can keep you looking young and preserved forever
<br/><span></span>With a fountain to spray on your youth whenever<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>Cause I really always knew that my little crime would be cold
<br/><span></span>That's why I got a heater for your thighs
<br/><span></span>And I know, I know it's not your time, but bye-bye
<br/><span></span>And a word to the wise when the fire dies
<br/><span></span>You think it's over but it's just begun
<br/><span></span>But baby don't cry.<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>You had my heart, at least for the most part
<br/><span></span>Cause everybody's gotta die sometime
<br/><span></span>We fell apart, let's make a new start
<br/><span></span>Cause everybody's gotta die sometime, yeah, yeah
<br/><span></span>But baby don't cry<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>Possibilities I'd never considered
<br/><span></span>Are occurring the likes of which I'd never heard
<br/><span></span>Now an angry soul comes back from beyond the grave
<br/><span></span>To repossess a body with which I misbehaved<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>Smiling right from ear to ear
<br/><span></span>Almost laughed herself to tears<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>Must have stabbed him fifty fucking times
<br/><span></span>I can't believe it
<br/><span></span>Ripped his heart out right before his eyes
<br/><span></span>Eyes over easy
<br/><span></span>Eat it, eat it, eat it
<br/><span></span>(Eat the shit out of him)<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>Now that it's done, I realize the error of my ways
<br/><span></span>I must return back to apologize from somewhere far beyond the grave<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>I gotta make up for what I've done
<br/><span></span>Cause I was all up in a piece of Heaven
<br/><span></span>While you burned in hell, no peace forever<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>Cause I really always knew that my little crime would be cold
<br/><span></span>That's why I got a heater for your thighs
<br/><span></span>And I know, I know it's not your time, but bye-bye
<br/><span></span>And a word to the wise when the fire dies
<br/><span></span>You think it's over but it's just begun

<br/><span></span>Cause everybody's gotta die sometime, yeah, yeah
<br/><span></span>But baby don't cry<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>(What will you do?)
<br/><span></span>I will suffer for so long
<br/><span></span>(Not long enough)
<br/><span></span>To make it up to you
<br/><span></span>(I pray to God that you do)
<br/><span></span>I'll do whatever you want me to do.
<br/><span></span>(Well then I'll grant you one chance)
<br/><span></span>And if it's not enough
<br/><span></span>(If it's not enough, if it's not enough)
<br/><span></span>If it's not enough
<br/><span></span>(Not enough)
<br/><span></span>Try again
<br/><span></span>(Try again)
<br/><span></span>And again
<br/><span></span>(And again)
<br/><span></span>Over and over again<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>Coming back, coming back
<br/><span></span>We'll live forever, live forever
<br/><span></span>Let's have wedding, have a wedding
<br/><span></span>Let's start the killing, start the killing<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>Do you take this man in death for the rest of your unnatural life?
<br/><span></span>Yes, I do<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>Do you take this woman in death for the rest of your unnatural life?
<br/><span></span>I do
<br/><span></span>I now pronounce you..<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>Cause I really always knew that my little crime would be cold
<br/><span></span>That's why I got a heater for your thighs
