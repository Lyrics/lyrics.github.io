    <div class="view"><pre>Take the time just to listen
When the voices screaming are much too loud
Take a look in the distance
Try and see it all

Chances are that ya might find
That we share a common discomfort now
I feel I'm walking a fine line
Tell me only if it's real

Still I'm on my way
(On and on it goes)
Vacant hope to take

Hey, I can't live in here for another day
Darkness has kept the light concealed, grim as ever
Hold onto faith as I dig another grave
Meanwhile the mice endure the wheel, real as ever
And it seems I've been buried alive

I walk the fields through the fire
Taking steps until I found solid ground
Follow dreams reaching higher
Couldn't survive the fall

Much has changed since the last time
And I feel a little less certain now
Ya know I jumped at the first sign
Tell me only if it's real

Memories seem to fade
(On and on it goes)
Wash my view away

Hey, I can't live in here for another day
Darkness has kept the light concealed, grim as ever
Hold onto faith as I dig another grave
Meanwhile the mice endure the wheel, real as ever

And I'm chained like a slave
Trapped in the dark
Slammed all the locks
Death calls my name
And it seems I've been buried alive

Take you down now, burn it all out
Throw you all around, get your fucking hands off me
What's it feel like? Took the wrong route
Watch it fall apart now you're knocking at the wrong gate
For you to pay the toll, a price for you alone
The only deal you'll find, I'll gladly take your soul

While it seems sick, sober up quick
Psycho lunatic crushing you with hands of fate
Shamed to find out, when it's too late
But you're all the same, trapped inside; Inferno awaits
Evil thoughts can hide, I'll help release the mind
I'll peel away the skin, release the dark within

This is now your life
Strike you from the light
This is now your life
Die buried alive

This is now your life (what's it feel like?)
Strike you from the light (let me take in your soul)
This is now your life (what's it feel like?)
Die buried alive (let me take in your soul)

This is now your life
Die buried alive</pre></div>
