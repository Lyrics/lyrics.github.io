    <div class="view"><pre>You've gotta die, gotta die, gotta die for your government?
Die for your country? That's shit!

You've gotta die, gotta die, gotta die for your government?
Die for your country? That's shit!

There's a gulf war vet, dying a slow cold death
And the government says, "We don't know the source of his sickness."
But don't believe what they say, because your government is lying
They've done it before, and don't you know they'll do it again
A secret test, government built virus
"Subject Test Group: Gulf Battle Field Troops"

You've gotta die, gotta die, gotta die for your government?
Die for your country? That's shit!

You've gotta die, gotta die, gotta die for your government?
Die for your country? That's shit!

First World War veterans slaughtered, by General Eisenhower
You give them your life, they give you a stab in the back
Radiation, agent orange, tested on U.S. soils
Guinea pigs for western corporations
I never have, I never will
Pledge allegiance to their flag
You're getting used, you'll end up dead

You've gotta die, gotta die, gotta die for your government?
Die for your country? That's shit!

You've gotta die, gotta die, gotta die for your government?
Die for your country? That's shit!

I don't need you to tell me what to do
And I don't need you to tell me what to be... FUCK YOU!
I don't need you to tell me what to say
And I don't need you to tell me what to think! What to think!
What to think, what to think, what to think, think, think, think!

You've gotta die, gotta die, gotta die for your government?
Die for your country? That's shit!

You've gotta die, gotta die, gotta die for your government?
Die for your country? That's shit!</pre></div>
