<br/><span></span>Sit down, drank, stand up, drank
<br/><span></span>Pass out, drank, wake up, drank
<br/><span></span>Faded, drank, faded, drank<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>Now I done grew up 'round some people livin' their life in bottles
<br/><span></span>Granddaddy had the golden flask, backstroke every day in Chicago
<br/><span></span>Some people like the way it feels, some people wanna kill their sorrows
<br/><span></span>Some people wanna fit in with the popular, that was my problem
<br/><span></span>I was in a dark room, loud tunes, looking to make a vow soon
<br/><span></span>That I'ma get fucked up, fillin' up my cup, I see the crowd mood
<br/><span></span>Changin' by the minute and the record on repeat
<br/><span></span>Took a sip then another sip, then somebody said to me<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>"Nigga, why you babysitting only two or three shots?
<br/><span></span>I'mma show you how to turn it up a notch
<br/><span></span>First you get a swimming pool full of liquor, then you dive in it
<br/><span></span>Pool full of liquor, then you dive in it<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>I wave a few bottles, then I watch 'em all flock
<br/><span></span>All the girls wanna play Baywatch

<br/><span></span>I am your conscience, if you do not hear me, then you will be history, Kendrick
<br/><span></span>I know that you're nauseous right now and I'm hopin' to lead you to victory, Kendrick
<br/><span></span>If I take another one down, I'ma drown in some poison, abusin' my limit
<br/><span></span>I think that I'm feelin' the vibe, I see the love in her eyes, I see the feelin'
<br/><span></span>The freedom is granted as soon as the damage of vodka arrived
<br/><span></span>This how you capitalize, this is parental advice
<br/><span></span>Then apparently I'm over influenced by what you are doin'
<br/><span></span>I thought I was doin' the most till someone said to me<br/><span></span><br/><span></span>"Nigga, why you babysitting only two or three shots?

<br/><span></span>All I have in life is my new appetite for failure
<br/><span></span>And I got hunger pain that grow insane
<br/><span></span>Tell me do that sound familiar?
<br/><span></span>If it do then you're like me, making excuse that your relief
<br/><span></span>Is in the bottom of the bottle and the greenest indo leaf
<br/><span></span>As the window open I release everything that corrode inside of me
<br/><span></span>I see you joking, why you laugh? Don't you feel bad?
<br/><span></span>I probably sleep and never ever wake up
