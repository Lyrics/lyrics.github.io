    <div class="view"><pre>(Coming in loud and clear
I can feel that you are here
You are coming in
Loud and clear)

No one has seen me
No one has reached me
'Cause the way is just too long
I have a thousand names
And I know many tricks
To dissapear when you get too close

You wanna find me
But you can't blind me
I will tell you something
You already know
Don't be disappointed
If your mission fails this time

Coming in loud and clear
I can feel that you are here
You are coming in
Loud and clear

Coming in loud and clear
I can feel that you are here
You are coming in
Loud and clear

It's time for me to start
I have to reach the other shore
Before the day will rise
I have to choose a single name
Leave the past behind and change the facts

If I won't start now, I will never do
I walk on frozen ground
My feet are losing contact
It is uncertain
I hope I will arrive
I'm going on into your direction

Coming in loud and clear
I can feel that you are here
You are coming in
Loud and clear

Coming in loud and clear
I can feel that you are here
You are coming in
Loud and clear

Coming in loud and clear
I can feel that you are here
You are coming in
Loud and clear

Coming in loud and clear
I can feel that you are here
You are coming in
Loud and clear

(Coming in loud and clear
I can feel that you are here
You are coming in
Loud and clear)

Coming in loud and clear
I can feel that you are here
You are coming in
Loud and clear</pre></div>
